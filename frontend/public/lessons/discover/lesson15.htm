					In 1943, Japanese occupation forces ordered hundreds
					of American and European “enemy nationals” to an
					internment camp in China’s Shantung Province. They
					had to endure months of boredom, frustration, overcrowding,
					and fear. Personalities clashed, tempers flared. Petty squabbles
					multiplied.
				</p>

				<p>
					But one man was described by an internee as “without a doubt
					the person most in demand and most respected and loved in
					camp”-Eric Liddell, a missionary from Scotland.
				</p>

				<p>
					A Russian prostitute in camp would later recall that Liddell
					was the only man who’d ever done anything for her without
					wanting to be repaid in kind. When she first came into camp,
					alone and snubbed, he put up some shelves for her
				</p>
				<p>
					Another internee recalled, “He had a gentle, humorous way
					of soothing ruffled tempers.” At one angry meeting of the
					internees, everybody was demanding that someone else do
					something about the restless teenagers who were getting into
					trouble. Liddell came up with a solution. He organized sports,
					crafts, and classes for the kids, and began spending his evenings
					with them.
				</p>

				<p>
					Liddell had won fame and glory at the 1924 Olympics, taking
					a gold medal in the 400 meters race. But in that cramped
					compound he showed himself a winner in the Christian race
					as well, earning the admiration of the most worldly internees.
					What made him so special? You could have discovered his
					secret at 6 a.m. each morning. That’s when he tiptoed quietly
					past sleeping companions, settled down at a table, and lit a
					small lamp to illuminate his notebook and Bible. Eric Liddell
					sought grace and strength each day in the riches of God’s Word

					1. THE GUIDEBOOK TO THE CHRISTIAN LIFESTYLE
				</h2>

				<p>
					T
					he Bible was written as a guidebook for the Christian. It is
					full of stories of real people like us who have experienced the
					same challenges we face every day. Getting to know these
					Bible characters-their joys and sorrows, their problems and
					opportunities-helps us mature as Christians.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he psalmist David pictures our daily dependence on the Word
					of God by comparing it to a flashlight [torchlight]:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.” -Psalm 119:105. (Unless otherwise noted,
					all Scriptural texts
					in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International
					Version of the Bible [NIV].)
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he illumination we get each day from the Bible makes clear
					the qualities we need in our lives and the principles of spiritual
					growth. Above all, the Bible presents us with Jesus, the Light of
					the World. Life only makes sense when Jesus is shining on it.

					2. A TRANSFORMING FRIENDSHIP
				</h2>

				<p>
					Christ wants the Bible to be as real to you as a personal letter
					from a close friend.
				</p>



				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from
					my Father I have made known to you.” -John 15:15.

				<p>
					Jesus wants the very best for us. His Word brings us into God’s
					inner circle: those He confides in and personally instructs.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.” -John 16:33.
				</p>


				<p>
					In order to experience this peace, this secure relationship with
					Christ, we need to read the letters He sends us. That’s what the
					Bible is: correspondence from heaven. Don’t leave those letters
					unopened. The transforming message you need is in the Word.
				</p>

				<p>
					Here is one typical testimony about the Bible’s impact: “I
					needed help, and I found it in Jesus. Every want was supplied,
					the hunger of my soul was satisfied; the Bible is to me the
					revelation of Christ. I believe in Jesus because He is to me a
					divine Savior. I believe the Bible because I have found it to be
					the voice of God to my soul.” -The Ministry of Healing, p. 461.

					3. GUIDELINES FOR LIVING IN THE BIBLE AND THE

				</h2>

				<p>
					A brief look at the Ten Commandments will help us understand
					why they and the Bible are an indispensable basis for right
					living.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Commandments naturally fall into two divisions. The first
					four define our relationship to God, and the last six define our
					relationship to other people. They are found in Exodus 20:3-17.

						<p>
							One day as Jesus was teaching, an enthusiastic young man
							hurried up to Him and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must
							I do to get eternal life?” (Matthew 19:16). Christ could see that
							he was wrestling with a money problem and advised him to get
							rid of his possessions and “obey the commandments” (verse
							17). The young man tried to sidestep Christ’s diagnosis of his
							problem by asking which commandments He was talking
							about. Jesus listed several of the Ten Commandments (Verses
							18, 19).
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally, the “rich young ruler” turned and walked away sadly
							(verses 20-22). He
							could give mental
							assent to the Ten
							Commandments,
							but he couldn’t
							obey the spirit
							of the law by
							abandoning
							his selfish way
							of life. The Ten
							Commandments
							show us the

					5. GUIDE TO A HAPPY LIFE
				</h2>

				<p>
					T
					he book of Ecclesiastes is a report of Solomon’s search for
					happiness. He records his quest for happiness in the riches of
					the world: magnificent houses, productive vineyards, beautiful gardens, and orchards of luscious
					fruit. He multiplied servants.
					He found himself surrounded with every material thing a
					person could desire. But happiness eluded him, and he wrote:
				</p>


				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“When I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had
					toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after
					the wind.” -Ecclesiastes 2:11.
				</p>

				<p>
					Solomon then turned to searching out the pleasures of this
					world in hope of finding happiness. He was taken in by wine,
					women, and song. His conclusion:
				</p>

				<p>
					“Meaningless! Meaningless! . . . Everything is meaningless!” -Ecclesiastes 12:8
				</p>

				<p>
					Solomon had once tasted and seen that the Lord is good. As he
					compared his early life of obedience toGod with his reckless
					chase for happiness in the things of sin, his verdict:
				</p>

				<p>
					“Here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep
					his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.” -Ecclesiastes 12:13.
				</p>

				<p>
					Solomon felt he could find a shortcut to happiness in a wild
					life. Toward the close of his life, he was man enough to admit
					his error. To save others from the same error, he wrote, “He
					that keepeth the law, happy is he.” -Proverbs 29:18, KJV

					6. THE TEN COMMANDMENTS AN INDISPENSABLE
					NEW TESTAMENT GUIDE
				</h2>

				<p>
					In the New Testament, James testified:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just
					one point is guilty of breaking all of it. For he who said, ‘Do
					not commit adultery,’ also said, ‘Do not murder.’ If you do not
					commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a
					lawbreaker. Speak and act as those who are going to be judged
					by the law that gives freedom.” -James 2:10-12.
				</p>

				<p>
					Charles Spurgeon, the great Baptist preacher of the past century,
					declared: “The law of God is divine law- holy, heavenly, perfect.
					. . . There is not a command too many; there is not one too
					few, but it is so incomparable that its perfection is proof of its
					divinity.”
				</p>

				<p>
					John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist church,
					wrote this about the enduring nature of the law: “The moral
					law contained in Ten Commandments . . . He [Christ] did not
					take away. . . . Every part of this law must remain in force upon
					all mankind and in all ages.”-Sermons, vol. l, pp. 221, 222.
				</p>

				<p>
					Billy Graham, the world’s most respected evangelical evangelist,
					regards the Ten Commandments so highly that he has written
					an entire book about their importance to the Christian.

					7. POWER TO OBEY
				</h2>

				<p>
					T
					he Bible and the Ten Commandments are an unchangeable,
					indispensable, perfect guide to happy living. Yet hearts are still
					in conflict. One woman expressed it like this: “I believe the Ten
					Commandments are binding, I am certain that keeping them
					leads to happiness. I have tried my very best to keep them, but
					I just can’t do it. I’m beginning to believe that no one else can.”
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he tendency of the natural person is to try to live a life of
					obedience to God’s commands. But in answer to such trying,
					over and over again from within the blackened heart of a
					person comes the frustrated response, “I can’t obey!” Why?
					Because:
				</p>


				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“The sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God’s
					law, nor can it do so.” -Romans 8:7.
				</p>

				<p>
					What is the purpose of the Ten Commandment law
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Through the law we become conscious of sin.” -Romans 3:20
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he function of the law is to lead us to utter realization that we
					are hopelessly lost sinners in need of a Savior.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“The law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might
					be justified by faith.” -Galatians 3:24.
				</p>

				<p>
					Jesus is the answer! Once we are at Jesus’ feet in absolute
					helplessness, by faith we can receive forgiveness for our sins
					and power from Him to obey His commandments.

					8. LOVING OBEDIENCE TO THE TEN
					COMMANDMENTS
				</h2>

				<p>
					Jesus tells us that obedience is the result of love:
				</p>
				<p>
					“If you love me, you will obey what I command.” -John 14:15.
				</p>

				<p>
					If we love God, we will obey the first four commandments
					which define our relationship to God; and if we love people, we
					will obey the last six which define our relationship with others.
					The person who tramples on the Ten Commandments sins:
				</p>


				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.” -1 John 3:4.
				</p>

				<p>
					But thank God, we have a Savior who came to this world and
					died, was resurrected, and now lives for one purpose:
				</p>

				<p>
					“But you know that He appeared SO THAT HE MIGHT TAKE
					AWAY OUR SINS.” -Verse 5
				</p>

				<p>
					Our Savior forgives and removes our sinfulness (1 John 1:9).
					He then promises to give us His love to love with-the great
					antidote to a life of selfishness and sin:
				</p>

				<p>
					“GOD HAS POURED OUT HIS LOVE IN OUR HEARTS by
					the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.” -Romans 5:5.
				</p>

				<p>
					We have no innate ability to keep God’s law. God’s love “poured
					out . . . in our hearts” is our only hope.

					9. GOD’S GRACE AND OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW
				</h2>

				<p>
					Salvation is a gift. We cannot earn it. We can only accept it by
					faith. We receive justification (right standing with God) as a
					gift, solely through faith because of God’s grace.

							“For it is BY GRACE YOU HAVE BEEN SAVED, through
							FAITH-and this not from yourselves, it is THE GIFT OF
							GOD-not by works, so that no one can boast.” -Ephesians 2:8
						</p>

						<p>
							We cannot keep the commandments by our own works-by
							trying. We cannot keep the commandments to be saved. But when we come to Jesus in faith and
							submission and are saved,
							his love fills our hearts. As a result of this divine grace and
							acceptance, we desire to follow Him and obey Him through
							the power of His love in our hearts (Romans 5:5).

						<p>
							Paul stresses the futility of human effort and indicates that we

							“Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By

						</p>


						<p>
							Why? Because a heart motivated by love produces a life of

					Eric Liddell demonstrated that, even in the worst of

					love relationship with
					Christ energized him

					and enabled Him to
					meet “the righteous
					requirements of the
					law” (Romans 8:1-4).
					A love relationship
					with the crucified
					and risen Savior can
					produce that quality
					of life. Have you
					discovered this secret
