					In the early 1960s, Brother Andrew, a man from
					Holland, smuggled a load of Bibles in his VW across
					the Romanian border and past communist guards.
					He checked into a hotel and began praying that God
					would lead him to the right Christian groups-the ones
					who could best use his copies of the Scriptures.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					hat weekend Andrew walked up to the hotel clerk and
					asked where he might find a church. The clerk looked at
					him a little strangely and answered, “We don’t have many
					of those, you know. Besides you couldn’t understand the
					language.”
				</p>

				<p>
					“Didn’t you know?” Andrew replied, “Christians speak a
					kind of universal language.”
					“Oh, what’s that?”
					“It’s called Agape.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he clerk had never heard of it, but Andrew assured him,
					“It’s the most beautiful language in the world.” Andrew
					was able to locate several church groups in the area and
					managed to arrange a meeting with the president and
					secretary of a certain denomination. Unfortunately,
					although both Andrew and these men knew several
					European languages, they found they had none in
					common. So there they sat staring at each other. Andrew
					had travelled many dangerous miles with his precious
					cargo, but there seemed no way of telling whether these
					men were genuine Christian brothers or government
					informants
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally he spotted a Romanian Bible on a desk in the
					office. Andrew reached into his pocket and pulled out
					a Dutch Bible. He turned to 1 Corinthians 16:20 and
					held the Bible out, pointing to the name of the book,
					which they could recognize. Instantly their faces lit up.
					T
					hey quickly found the same chapter and verse in their
					Romanian Bibles and read: “All the brothers here send
					you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.” The
					men beamed back at Andrew. Then one of them looked
					through his Bible and found Proverbs 25:25. Andrew
					found the verse and read: “Like cold water to a weary
					soul is good news from a distant land.”
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					hese men spent half an hour conversing and sharing
					just through the words of Scripture. They were so happy
					in this fellowship that crossed all cultural boundaries that
					they laughed until tears came to their eyes. Andrew knew
					he had found his brothers. When he showed them his
					load of Bibles, the Romanians were overwhelmed and
					embraced him again and again.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					hat evening at the hotel, the clerk approached Andrew and remarked, “Say, I looked up ‘agape’ in the
					dictionary.
					T
					here’s no language by that name. That’s just a Greek
					word for love.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Andrew replied, “That’s it. I was speaking in it all
					afternoon.” Have you discovered that beautiful language?
					In this Guide you’ll learn about how God can bring all of
					us into His great
					circle of love.

					1. THE CHURCH CREATED FOR FELLOWSHIP
				</h2>

				<p>
					Jesus established the church in order to meet the basic
					human requirement of nurture and support. We all
					have needs. And that’s what the church is all about. It’s a
					place where we come to fellowship and help each other.
					Scripture reveals a dynamic apostolic church which called
					men and women into a joyful fellowship that extended all
					the way up to the Almighty:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so
					that you also may have FELLOWSHIP WITH US. And
					OUR FELLOWSHIP IS WITH THE FATHER AND
					WITH HIS SON, Jesus Christ. We write this to make our
					JOY COMPLETE.” -1 John 1:3, 4.
				</p>

				<p>
					(Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the
					DISCOVER guides are from the New International
					Version of the Bible [NIV].) A community of hearts
					bonded through contact with Jesus and with one another,
					experience “joy” to the fullest! They’re all speaking the
					same language, the language of love
				</p>

				<p>
					Christians become part of an extended family. They
					become brothers and sisters in Christ since all have
					a kindred spirit. The broader the unity of belief, the
					stronger the ties among Christians
				</p>

				<p>
					The members of the churches established by Jesus’ apostles
					were bound together by their similar beliefs, their love of
					God, and their desire to serve Him and share His grace
					to the world. This close bond of fellowship was one of the
					reasons this powerless and persecuted minority turned
					the world upside down
				</p>

					2. THE CHURCH CHRIST ESTABLISHED
				</h2>
				<p>
					Does Christ have a church, or is the whole idea of a
					religious organization just a human invention? Jesus
					answers:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“On this ROCK I will build my church, and the gates of
					hell will not overcome it.” -Matthew 16:18, margin.
				</p>

				<p>
					Jesus is the anchoring Rock, the Cornerstone, of His
					church. What group formed a part of the foundation?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
					with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.” -
					Ephesians 2:20.
				</p>

				<p>
					What did the Lord accomplish when the gospel was
					preached?
				</p>

				<p>
					“And the Lord added to the CHURCH daily such as
					should be saved.” -Acts 2:47 KJV. When Jesus established
					the church, He promised that “the gates of hell will not
					overcome it” (Matthew 16:18), and the Christian church
					still endures. It has had extremely powerful enemies-from
					Roman emperors to communist dictators-but the blood
					of martyrs has only caused it to grow stronger. When one
					Christian was burned at the stake or tossed to the lions,
					several others sprang up to take his or her place. Skeptics
					have done their best to reason the Christian Church away.
					But Christian truth competes more eloquently than ever
					in a scientific, secular age.

							One of the church’s greatest challenges came soon after

							Empire. The church grew prosperous-and eventually was

							But the Lord always preserved a core of courageous and
							faithful believers who, in the bleak and difficult times,
							shone bright as stars on a moonless night.

							relationships to
							the other members
							of the family and
							contributing to
							their well-being
							(Ephesians 2:19).
							Paul also represents
							the church as a living
							body, with Christ
							Himself as its head
							(Colossians
							1:18).
						</p>
						<p>
							When we are baptized, we testify to our faith in Jesus and

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm"></p>
				“For we were all BAPTIZED by one Spirit INTO ONE
				BODY.” -1 Corinthians 12:13.
				</p>

				<p>
					The book of Revelation pictures the risen Christ walking
					among the churches, showing His care over them
					(Revelation 1:20, 12, 13). Christ has never forsaken His
					people, and He never will.

				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					3. A CHURCH WITH A PURPOSE
				</h2>

				<p>
					Church attendance is vital for a Christian. We need the
					support of others to keep our faith alive and growing.
				</p>
				<p>
					T
					he church also plays three other important roles:
				</p>

				<div class="space-y-3 ">
					<p>
						(1) The church guards the truth. As the “pillar and
						foundation of the truth” (1 Timothy 3:15), the church
						upholds and defends God’s truth before the world. We
						need the collective wisdom of other believers to help us
						focus on the essential truths of Scripture.

					</p>

					<p>
						(2) The church is an example of what God’s grace can do
						for sinners. The changes that Christ has made in the lives
						of believers give acclaim to the God who calls us “into his
						wonderful light” (1 Peter 2:9).
					</p>

					<p>
						(3) God’s people are His witnesses to a needy world.
						Just before He returned to heaven, Jesus promised His
						disciples:
					</p>


				</div>

				<p>
					“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes
					on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and
					in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” -Acts 1:8
				</p>
				<p>
					It is a great privilege for the church to take the message of
					God’s tremendous love worldwide.
				</p>



			</div>


			<!-- section 4 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					4. ORGANIZED FOR STRENGTH
				</h2>

				<p>
					The church that Christ established had a definite
					organization. One could be included in, or excluded
					from, its membership (Matthew 18:15-18). God’s church
					appointed leaders and had a world headquarters as well
					as local meeting places (Acts 8:14; 14:23; 15:2; 1 Timothy
					3:1-13). When they were baptized, believers joined an organized group. (Acts 2:41 and 47).
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“And let us consider how we may spur one another on
					toward love and good deeds. Let us not give up meeting
					together, as some are in the habit of doing, but LET US
					ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER-and all the more as you
					see the Day [of Christ’s coming] approaching.” -Hebrews
					10:24, 25.
				</p>
				<p>
					T
					his is, in a nutshell, what a healthy church group does. Its
					members build each other up in the faith, they encourage
					one other. God organized His church to strengthen God’s
					people and also to serve the world. We can do far more
					together than we can as isolated individuals. Take just one
					example: the Seventh- day Adventist Church. We carry on
					an extensive medical work around the world-from inner
					city health vans to clinics in remote islands of the South
					Pacific. Our educational institutions have brought tens
					of thousands of youth to a knowledge of a better life in
					Christ-from Loma Linda University, pioneering in heart
					transplants, to tiny mission schools scattered through the
					African interior. We carry on famine and disaster relief
					through ADRA. Local churches help clothe and feed the
					poor and homeless at thousands of Community Service
					Centers. And groups of Adventist believers are sharing the message of salvation in more than 200
					countries.
					Only an organized group of dedicated Christians could
					have this worldwide impact.
				</p>
				<p>
					Christ and the apostles compared the church to a body,
					and pointed out that all parts of the body are needed (1
					Corinthians 12:21-28). All body parts are not exactly
					alike, yet all are important and all must work together
					in harmony. An eye separated from the body can’t see.
					A hand cut off has no value. Whether we are an eye, a
					hand, or only a finger, we can’t be truly effective for
					Christ totally on our own. Belonging to a church, being
					united to the other members of the body, strengthens us
					as Christians.
				</p>

			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					5. THE JOY OF WORSHIP
				</h2>

				<p>
					Deep in our hearts lies a longing to worship God, and
					that need can wither away unless given expression. How
					did the psalmist feel when he thought about going to a
					place of worship?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“I REJOICED with those who said to me, ‘Let us go to
					the house of the LORD.’” -Psalm 122:1.
				</p>
				<p>
					What part does music have in public worship?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Worship the Lord with gladness; come before him with
					joyful songs.” -Psalm 100:2.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he Bible tells us that giving offerings is an appropriate
					part of divine worship.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Bring an offering and come into his courts. Worship the
					LORD in the splendor of his holiness.” -Psalm 96:8-9.
				</p>

				<p>
					Prayer is also a vital aspect of public worship.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before
					the LORD our Maker.” -Psalm 95:6.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bible study and preaching are central to New Testament
					worship. Beginning with Peter’s sermon on the day of
					Pentecost, found in Acts 2, and from the time of the
					Protestant Reformers to our day, every great religious
					revival has been based on biblical preaching. Why?
					Because “the word of God is living and active. Sharper
					than any double-edged sword” (Hebrews 4:12-13).
				</p>


			</div>


			<!-- section 6 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					6. WHAT’S RIGHT WITH THE CHURCH?
				</h2>

				<p>
					Some object that the church is full of imperfect people.
					What Henry Ward Beecher said is true: “The church is
					not a gallery for the exhibition of eminent Christians, but
					a school for the education of imperfect ones.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Since none of us is perfect, the church will never be
					perfect either. In one of His parables Jesus reminded us
					that weeds grow among the wheat (Matthew 13:24-30).
					When we read the New Testament letters of Paul, we
					discover that the apostolic church had critical problems.
					And the church today often has serious defects. But
					please remember that no faulty congregation can ever
					destroy or disturb the Great Cornerstone of the church-
					Jesus Christ Himself. So in imperfect churches we must
					keep our primary gaze on the Savior who ministers to us. Despite its faults, the church belongs to
					Him, so focus on
					Christ.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“CHRIST LOVED THE CHURCH AND GAVE
					HIMSELF UP FOR HER to make her holy, cleansing
					her by the washing with water through the word, and
					to present her to himself as a radiant church, without
					stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and
					blameless.” -Ephesians 5:25-27.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he church is so important to Jesus that He “gave himself
					up for her” when He died for each of usindividually and
					for the church collectively. So church membership should
					be important to you. Are you a member of Christ’s body?
				</p>

					7. FINDING A CHURCH
				</h2>



				<p>
					How many true faiths does Jesus have in the world?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“There is one body and one Spirit, . . . one Lord, ONE
					FAITH, one baptism.” -Ephesians 4:4, 5.
				</p>



				<p>
					Since Christ has only “one faith,” how can we know which
					one it is? Jesus gives us the key:

				</p>




				<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
					<div class="col-span-3 space-y-2 text-justify  md:px-0">

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“If anyone chooses to do God’s will, he will find out
							whether my teaching comes from God or whether I
							speak on my own.” -John 7:17. (See also John 8:31, 32.)
						</p>

						<p>
							When we make a commitment to do God’s will, He
							will help us see whether the teaching is from God or is
							only human tradition. The key ingredient when finding
							a church is examining its respect for and allegiance to
							the Word of God. Genuine fellowship is built around
							Scripture, not just around a charismatic leader or a great
							institution.

				<p>
					Continue making discoveries in these guides, walk in
