					Contemporary researchers have taken pains to
					document a truth which the Bible first established:
					human beings are an integrated whole. What
					we often divide into the physical, mental, and spiritual
					parts of a person are really interrelated and inseparable.
					In other words, what affects the mind, affects the body.
					Our spiritual condition has an impact on our physical
					condition, and vice versa. We are a whole person.
				</p>

				<p>
					For example, scientific researchers have found in
					controlled studies that happy, joyful laughter produces
					measurable changes in a person’s immune system. You
					can actually help your body fight disease better by being
					happy! These studies show how closely the mind and
					body work together.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					housands of years ago God’s Word pointed out this vital
					connection between the mind and body which has only
					recently been accepted into medical theory:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit
					dries up the bones.” -Proverbs 17:22. (Unless otherwise
					noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are
					from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the apostle John, how closely related are the
					mind and body to our spiritual well being?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Dear friend, I pray that you may ENJOY GOOD
					HEALTH and that all may go well with you, even as
					your soul is getting along well.” -3 John 2.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our Creator wants us to “enjoy good health.” The Word
					of God can serve as our fountain of health, as well as our
					fountain of eternal life. Since physical and mental health
					and our spiritual well-being go hand-in-hand, Paul
					makes the following appeal:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all
					for the glory of God.” -1 Corinthians 10:31.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he gospel includes both physical and spiritual
					restoration. A healthful lifestyle can help us be vibrant
					Christians. Here are eight principles to follow if you
					really want to live a healthier and more productive life:
				</p>



			</section>

			<!-- section 1 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					1. PURE AIR
				</h2>

				<p>
					Pure, fresh air is essential to good health. During the day
					and while sleeping at night, proper ventilation of our
					home and workplace insures that our blood will always
					distribute enough oxygen to every part of the body.
					Taking deep breaths during a morning walk is a great
					way to oxygenate your body.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he kind of air we breathe is obviously important. Be careful not to subject yourself to fumes, gases
					or airborne
					bacteria from some hidden source. Smoking pollutes the
					air and is one of today’s big killers. Scientific research has
					established a causal relationship between tobacco and
					lung cancer, emphysema, and heart disease. The body’s
					addiction to the nicotine in cigarettes makes smoking one of the hardest habits to
					break. Smoking will kill 12 million people a year by the
					year 2020 if the present trend continues.
				</p>



			</div>

			<!-- section 2 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					2. SUNLIGHT
				</h2>
				<p>
					“The benefits of sunlight are many:
				</p>
				<div class="pl-6 space-y-3">
					<p>
						“1. Fifteen to 30 minutes of daily exposure to sunlight
						in the early morning or late afternoon helps the
						body synthesize or make its own vitamin D, an
						essential nutrient/hormone in the skin. Vitamin D
						helps blood to produce calcium and phosphorus,
						which build and repair bone mass.
					</p>

					<p>
						“2. Sunlight acts as a disinfectant and a killer of
						bacteria.
					</p>

					<p>
						“3. The sun provides energy by which the plant
						kingdom can convert carbon dioxide and water
						into carbohydrates. . . . Without this process
						animals and humans would starve to death.
					</p>

					<p>
						“4. Sunlight also helps a person adjust to night work
						and relieves depression related to dark days where
						winter occurs. “A word of caution: Sunlight can
						also be harmful. Prolonged exposure can burn
						skin, increase the risk of skin cancer, speed up
						the aging process, damage the eyes, and cause
						cataracts.” [All quotations in this Guide are from
						Look Up and Live: A Guide to Health, Adult
						Lessons, First Quarter 1993, (Nampa, Idaho:
						Pacific Press Publishing Association). Much of
						the material in this Guide that is not in quotes is
						condensed from this same publication.]
					</p>

			<!-- section 3 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					3. REST
				</h2>

				<p>
					T
					he body must have rest in order to repair itself. We must
					have time for recreation and rest to relieve the tensions
					of work and family responsibilities. Without their
					required dosage of rest, people often experience anxiety,
					depression, and irritability. Such emotional stress can
					lead to illness, which will force us to take the rest our
					bodies were asking for all along.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					here’s simply no substitute for a good night’s sleep.
					Recharging our spiritual batteries on a daily basis is also
					important to physical health. A Christian’s daily time of meditation, Bible study, and prayer will
					heal the body as
					well as the soul.
				</p>

				<p>
					We also need a regular break from the work cycle, a
					weekly day of rest, and annual or semi-annual vacations.
				</p>




			</div>


			<!-- section 4 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					4. EXERCISE
				</h2>

				<p>
					Exercise is vital to our health:
				</p>

				<div class="pl-6 space-y-3">
					<p>
						“1. Exercise helps to normalize blood pressure.
					</p>

					<p>
						“2. Exercise allows more blood to reach all parts of the
						body, keeping the extremities warm.
					</p>

					<p>
						“3. Exercise releases both physical and emotional
						tension, helping you to feel better about life.
						Exercise is usually the best cure for worry and
						stress.
					</p>

					<p>
						“4. Exercise provides electrical energy to the brain and
						nerve cells. It promotes health by stimulating the
						immune system. When the body is kept in tone by
						proper exercise, the mind thinks more creatively
						and efficiently.
					</p>

					<p>
						“5. It can help with your complexion and keep you
						trim.
					</p>

					<p>
						“6. Exercise makes you more energetic, thus delaying
						both physical and emotional fatigue.
					</p>

					<p>
						“7. It aids in the brain’s production of a chemical
						that gives you a sense of well-being and increases
						your tolerance for pain.” If you have not been
						exercising, start slowly and increase gradually as
						you gain endurance. It may be wise to consult your
						physician before starting. Your goal should be to
						engage in any type of exercise that is comparable
						to walking one mile in 15 minutes four or more
						times a week.
					</p>

			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					5. WATER
				</h2>

						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="col-span-3 space-y-2 text-justify  md:px-0">

						<p>
							Since water is essential to every cell in the body, we
							should drink plenty of it.
						</p>

						<div class="space-y-3 pl-6">
							<p> “1. By weight the body is about 70 percent water. . . .</p>
							<p>“2. The body requires about two and one half quarts of
								water per day to perform all of its functions. Some
								of these functions include blood circulation, waste
								removal, nutrient transport, and digestion. . . .</p>

						</div>
					</div>


				</div>

				<p> “3. The average person has between 15 and 40 billion
					brain cells. Each one of those is 70 to 85 percent water. Sufficient water to supply
					these cells
					helps keep you mentally alert and helps prevent
					depression and irritability.
				</p>

				<p> “4. It is not only the water you drink that is important.
					A cool or tepid daily bath or shower improves
					circulation, thus energizing the body and mind.
					A shower or bath can also soothe jangled nerves,
					which can cause illness by weakening the immune
					system. Bathing also removes impurities from the
					skin and can reduce fever.”
				</p>

			</div>


			<!-- section 6 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					6. PROPER DIET
				</h2>

				<p>
					At creation God instructed Adam and Eve to eat a diet
					of nuts, grains, and fruits (Genesis 1:29). After Adam
					and Eve sinned, vegetables were added to their diet
					(Genesis 3:18). After the flood, the Creator added “clean”
					f
					lesh foods to the diet (Genesis 7:2-3, 9:1-6). The flesh
					of animals contains both saturated fat and cholesterol,
					which increase the risk of high blood pressure, stroke,
					heart disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes, and other
					diseases. Today many physicians advise those who eat
					meat to consume only lean, well-cooked meat and fish
					and to do so sparingly.
				</p>

				<p>
					Because people on a vegetarian diet are healthier and live
					longer, many experts in nutrition and health urge us to
					consider returning to humanity’s original diet of nuts,
					grains, and fruits with vegetables added.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you’d like to start a vegetarian menu, make sure you
					f
					irst understand how to provide a balanced diet without
					meat. Eat five or six servings a day of a variety of fruits,
					nuts, grains, legumes, and vegetables. Green and yellow
					vegetables, along with citrus fruits, are especially
					important. Use whole grain cereal flour, and use brown
					rice instead of white. Your intake of starches and complex
					carbohydrates should consist of six or more servings a
					day. Replace your intake of animal fats (butter, cream,
					lard, suet, etc.) with vegetable fats. The above diet is
					adequate without meat if you use dairy products. Those
					who choose to eat meat as a part of their diet, should eat
					only the meats that the Bible indicates are “clean,” or fit
					for humans to eat. When God gave people permission to
					eat meat after the flood (Genesis 7:2-3, Leviticus 11:47),
					He defined which of the flesh foods were clean, and
					which were unclean and not fit to eat.
				</p>

				<p>
					Read in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14 the list of
					birds, beasts, and fish God pronounced unfit for food.
					According to these chapters, clean animals must divide,
					or split, the hoof and also chew the cud. Clean fish must
					have both scales and fins. Scavenger birds are forbidden.
				</p>

				<p>
					Among the unclean animals, swine are especially
					mentioned and condemned (Deuteronomy 14:8). A
					high percentage of human bodies autopsied are infected
					with trichinae. These tiny worms are transmitted to
					people who eat infected pork. Current scientific research
					increasingly reveals why God declared some flesh
					unclean. One reason may be the danger of disease, such as the trichina worm in pork.
				</p>

				<p>
					Anotherreason may be the devastating effects of saturated
					fat on the human digestive system.
				</p>

				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					7. AVOID HARMFUL THINGS
				</h2>



				<p>
					What warnings does the Bible give about alcoholic
					beverages?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler; whoever is
					led astray by them is not wise.” - Proverbs 20:1. “Nor
					thieves nor the greedy nor DRUNKARDS nor slanderers
					nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.” -l
					Corinthians 6:10.
				</p>

				<p>
					Alcohol affects the following bodily systems:

				</p>

				<div class="space-y-3 pl-6">
					<p>
						“1. The immune system-Alcohol decreases the white
						cells’ ability to fight disease, thus increasing the
						risk
						of pneumonia, tuberculosis, hepatitis, and several
						cancers.
					</p>
					<p>
						“2. The endocrine system-Only two or three
						alcoholic drinks
						per day increase the risk of miscarriages, stillbirths, and
						premature births.
					</p>

					<p>
						“3. The circulatory system-The use of alcohol increases
						the risk of coronary heart disease, reduces blood
						sugar, and elevates blood fats and blood pressure,
						thus increasing hypertension.
					</p>

					<p>
						“4. The digestive system-Alcohol irritates the stomach,
						thereby causing gastric bleeding. . . . Habitual use
						of alcohol raises the risk of fatty liver, hepatitis,
						and cirrhosis of the liver.” Alcohol is responsible
						for a large percentage of suicides, auto deaths,
						child abuse cases, and home violence.

					8. TRUST IN DIVINE POWER
				</h2>


				<p>
					A person haunted by fear or guilt will find it hard to benefit
					fully from the health practices we’ve just described.
				</p>

				<p>
					But a person enjoying a positive faith in God will
					experience the ultimate source of well-being:
				</p>
				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his
					benefits- who forgives all your sins and HEALS ALL
					YOUR DISEASES, who REDEEMS YOUR LIFE from
					the pit.” -Psalm 103:2-4.
				</p>


				<p>
					David Larson, a consultant to the National Institute
					of Mental Health in the United States, did extensive
					research on the relationship between religion and health.
					His study demonstrated a direct connection between a
					Christian commitment and health. He was surprised to
					learn: Those who attend church live longer than those
					who don’t

							Church-goers have a reduced incidence of heart
							attack, hardening of the arteries, high blood pressure,
							and other diseases. Those who have faith in God live
							more productive lives because they are less likely to be
							depressed, to become alcoholics, to be jailed as repeat offenders, or to be trapped in an
							unhappy
							marriage.
							Trust in divine power is the keystone to genuine well
							being and a healthy and happy life
						</p>

						<p>
							Approximately 50,000 Seventh-day Adventists were
							studied, primarily in California, over 30 years. Results
							showed that Adventist men live 8.9 years longer and
							women 7.5 years longer than the general population.
							Studies of Adventists in Holland, Norway, and Poland
							show similar results. Researchers attribute the longer life
							span of Adventists to their following some or all of the
							eight health principles outlined in this guide. Those who
							follow these principles not only have a longer life, but
							also a much better quality of life.
						</p>
						<p>
							Applying the Bible’s
							perspective
							to
							our
							lives does make a
							difference in all kinds of
							practical ways, offering
							convincing evidence that
							Christianity is the most
							practical, reasonable
							religion in all the world.
							It changes people-their
							thinking and their
							actions-and creates a
							new lifestyle. Because
							of the close relationship
							between the mind, the
							body, and our spiritual
							life, Christians who live
							by the Word of God
							will want to follow the
							principles of a healthful lifestyle as they prepare for Jesus’
							second coming (1 John 3:1-3).
						</p>

						<p>
							Christ not only wants us to be ready to meet Him when
							He returns, He also wants to improve the quality of our
							present lives. We can cooperate with Him by following
							God’s basic health principles.

					If you are attempting to overcome some body-destroying
