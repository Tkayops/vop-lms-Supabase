					The famous mutineers who sank the British ship Bounty
					ended up settling with their native women on the
					lonely island of Pitcairn in the South Pacific. The group
					consisted of nine British sailors, six Tahitian men, ten Tahitian
					women, and a girl of fifteen. One of the sailors discovered how
					to distill alcohol, and soon drunkenness corrupted the island
					colony. Fighting among the men and women grew into violent
					exchanges.
				</p>

				<p>
					After a while only one of the original men who reached the
					island survived. But this man, Alexander Smith, discovered a
					Bible in one of the chests taken from the ship. He began to read
					it and to teach the others what it said.
					As he did so his own life changed, and finally the lives of all
					on the island. The islanders were completely isolated from
					the outside world until the arrival of the United States ship
					Topaz in 1808. Its crew found the island a thriving, prosperous
					community with no whisky, no jail, no crime. The Bible had
					changed the island from a hell on earth to an example of what
					God wants the world to be. And so it remains today.
					Does God still speak to people through the pages of the Bible?
					He certainly does. As I write this, I’m looking at the answer
					sheet sent to us by a student of one of our Bible courses. A note
					at the bottom states, “I am in prison, on death row, sentenced
					to die for a crime. Before I took this Bible course, I was lost,
					but now I have something to look forward to, and I have found
					a new love.”
					T
					he Bible possesses a power that can actually transform
					people’s lives. When people really begin to study the Bible, lives
					are dramatically changed

					2. WHO WROTE THE BIBLE?
				</h2>
				<p>
					The prophets gave God’s messages by voice and pen while
					they lived, and when they died, their writings lived after them.
					These prophetic messages were then gathered together, under
					God’s leading, in the book we call the Bible.
				</p>

				<div>
					<h3 class="font-semibold">
						But how reliable are their writings?
					</h3>

					<p class="italic font-semibold">
						“You must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came
						about by the prophet’s own interpretation. For prophecy never
						had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as
						they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.” -2 Peter 1:20, 21.
					</p>

					<p>
						The writers of the Bible wrote not according to their own will
						or desire, but only as they were moved, or inspired, by the
						Spirit of God. The Bible is God’s own Book!
						In the Bible God tells us about Himself and reveals His
						purposes for the human race. It shows God’s view of the past,
						and also opens up the future, telling us how the problem of evil
						will finally be resolved and how peace will come to our world.
					</p>

					<p class="font-semibold">
						Is all the Bible a message from God?
					</p>

					<p class="font-semibold italic">
						“All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching,
						rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that
						the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good
						work.” -2 Timothy 3:16, 17.
					</p>

					<p>
						T
						he Holy Bible affects human beings so profoundly because
						“all” the Bible is “God-breathed,” an inspired document, God’s
						Book. The prophets related what they saw and heard in human
						language, but their message came directly from God. So if you
						want to know what life is all about, read the Holy Scriptures.
						Reading the Bible will transform your life. The more you
						prayerfully read it, the more peace of mind you’ll experience.
					</p>

					<p>
						he same Holy Spirit who inspired the prophets to write the
						Bible, will make the Bible’s teachings, its gospel, effective in
						transforming your life if you invite the Spirit to be present as
						you read the Bible.

							The Bible is actually a library of 66 books. The 39 books of
							the Old Testament were composed from about 1450 B.C. to
							about 400 B.C., the 27 books of the New Testament between
							A.D. 50 and A.D. 100. The prophet Moses began the first five
							books of the Bible sometime before 1400 B.C. The apostle
							John penned the last book of the Bible, Revelation, about A.D.
							95. During the 1,500 years between the writing of the first
							and last books of the Bible, at least 38 other inspired writers
							made their contributions. Some were businessmen, others
							shepherds, fishermen, soldiers, physicians, preachers, kings
							human beings from all walks of life. They often lived within
							contrasting cultures and philosophies. But here is the wonder
							of it all: When the 66 books of the Bible with their 1,189
							chapters made up of 31,173 verses are brought together, we
							find perfect unity and harmony in the message they convey.
							Suppose a man should knock at your door and, when invited
							in, place an oddly shaped piece of marble on your living room
							floor, then leave without a word. Other visitors follow in
							succession until about 40 individuals have each deposited their
							numbered marble piece into place.
							When the last one has gone, you see with surprise that a
							beautiful statue stands before you. Then you learn that most of
							the “sculptors” had never met each other, coming, as they did,
							from South America, China, Russia, Africa, and other parts of
							the world. What would you have to conclude? That someone
							had planned the statue and had sent to each man accurate
							specifications for his particular piece of marble
						</p>

						<p>
							The Bible as a whole communicates one coherent message
							just like a perfect marble statue. One mind planned it all, the
							mind of God. Scripture’s remarkable unity gives evidence that
							though human beings wrote down the thoughts, they were
							inspired by God.

								The preservation of the Bible is remarkable. All of the
								early manuscripts of the Bible were copied by hand
								long before there were printing presses. Scribes made
								copies of the original manuscripts and distributed them.
								Thousands of copies of such manuscripts or portions of
								them still survive.
							</p>

							<p>
								Hebrew manuscripts of the Old Testament that go back
								150 to 200 years before Christ were found near the Dead
								Sea in 1947. It’s amazing that these two-thousand-year
								old scrolls contain exactly the same truths as we find
								in the Old Testament of Bibles printed today. This is
								powerful evidence of how reliable God’s Word is.
							</p>
							<p>
								The apostles first wrote much of the New Testament as
								letters they sent to Christian churches established after
								the death and resurrection of Christ. More than 4,500
								manuscripts of all or a part of the New Testament are
								on display in the great museums and libraries of Europe
								and America. Some of them date back to the second
								century. By comparing these early manuscripts with
								today’s Bible, we can readily see that the New Testament
								has also remained essentially unchanged since it was
								f
								irst written.
							</p>

							<p>
								Today the Bible or portions of it have been translated
								into over 2,060 languages and dialects. It is the world’s
								best-seller: over 150 million Bibles and Bible portions
								are sold each year.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								T
								he historical accuracy of the Bible is remarkable. Many
								archaeological discoveries have dramatically confirmed
								the accuracy of the Bible. Historians have discovered
								clay tablets and stone monuments which have brought
								to light names, places, and events previously known
								only from the Bible.
							</p>
							<p>
								For example, according to Genesis 11:31, Abraham and
								his family “set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to
								[the land of] Canaan.” Because only the Bible spoke of
								Ur, certain scholars stated that no such city had ever
								existed. Then archaeologists uncovered a temple tower
								in southern Iraq with a cylinder at the base written
								in cuneiform that contained the name Ur. Later finds
								revealed Ur as the thriving metropolis of a highly
								developed civilization. That city’s identity had been
								forgotten, only the Bible preserved its name-until the
								spade of the archaeologist confirmed its authenticity.
								And Ur is only one of many examples of archaeology
								confirming the accuracy of the Bible.
							</p>

						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								T
								he accurate fulfillment of Bible predictions shows
								that you can trust the Bible. Scripture contains many
								remarkable predictions of future events now being
								fulfilled before our eyes. We examine some of these
								exciting prophecies in future lessons.

					5. HOW TO UNDERSTAND THE BIBLE
				</h2>

				<P>
					Are you God's Word, keep these principles in mind
				</P>

				<ol class="list-decimal pl-8 ml-4 space-y-4">
					<li>
						Study the Bible with a prayerful heart. If you approach
						Scripture with a heart and mind opened through
						prayer, it becomes a personal contact with Jesus (John
						16:13-14).
					</li>

					<li>
						Read the Bible daily. Daily Bible study is a key to
						power in our lives, an encounter with the mind of God
						(Romans 1:16).
					</li>

					<li>
						As you read it, let the Bible speak for itself. Ask: what
						did the Bible writer intend to say? By grasping what a
						text means we can apply it intelligently to our life today.
					</li>

					<li>
						Study the Bible by subject. Compare scripture with
						scripture. Jesus used this method to prove that He was
						the Messiah:<br>
						<span class="italic text-sm font-semibold">
							"And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, he
							explained to them what was said in ALL the
							Scriptures concerning himself.” -Luke 24:27.
						</span>

						<p>
							By putting together all that the Bible has to say on a
							certain subject we gain a balanced perspective.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						Study the Bible to receive power to live for Christ. The
						Word of God is described in Hebrews 4:12 as a sharp,
						double-edged sword. It’s more than words on a page, it’s
						a living weapon in our hands to fight off temptations to
						sin. 3/4
					</li>

					<li>
						Listen as God speaks to you through His Word. If
						a person is to know the Bible truth about a certain
						subject, he or she must be willing to follow what it
						teaches (John 7:17), not what some person thinks, or
						what some church teaching asserts.

			Studying the Bible will strengthen your "understanding," give
			you the strength to overcome destructive habits, and enable
			you to develop physically, mentally, morally, and spiritually.
			The Bible speaks to the heart. It deals with the experiences
			of humanity—birth, love, marriage, parenthood, and death. It
			heals the deepest wound in human nature, sin and the misery
			resulting from it. God's Word is not a book of one race, one age,
			one nation, or one culture. Although written in the East, it also
			appeals to men and women in the West. It enters the homes of
			the humble and the mansions of the wealthy.
		</p>

		<p class="text-justify ">
			Children love its exciting stories. Its heroes inspire young
			people. The sick, the lonely, and the aged discover in it comfort
			and hope for a better life.
		</p>

		<p class="text-justify leading-relaxed">
			Because God works through the Bible, it has great power. It
			breaks even hearts hardened against all human emotion,
			softening and filling them with love. We have seen the Bible
			change a former bandit and opium smoker into a zealous
			preacher. We have seen the Bible turn a liar and a cheat into an
			honest and upright teacher. And we have seen this Book snatch
			people from the brink of suicide and give them a hopeful new
			beginning. The Bible awakens love among enemies. It makes
			the proud humble and the selfish generous.
		</p>

		<p class="text-justify">
			The Bible strengthens us in weakness, cheers us in despondency,
			comforts us in sorrow, guides us in uncertainty, and soothes us
			when weary. It shows us how to live courageously and how to
			die without fear.
		</p>

		<p class="text-justify leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
			God's Book, the Bible, can change your life! You'll see that more

		<p class="text-justify leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
			The greatest reason we should become acquainted with the
