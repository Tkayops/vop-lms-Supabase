                    Doctors Patricia and David Mrazek saw a great deal
                    of heartbreak in their work. As pediatric specialists
                    they dealt with many suffering children. But they
                    were struck by the fact that some kids bounced back from
                    disaster while others were crushed by it. Why? Why, for
                    example, does one child go to drugs, while another goes
                    to college? Why do some abused children grow up to
                    become abusers themselves, while others become good
                    parents?

                    he Mrazeks conducted an extensive survey to find
                    answers to these questions. In their study, one overriding
                    trait kept popping up among those kids who survived
                    trauma and went on to build healthy lives. The secret? “A
                    basic life view of optimism and hope.”

                    Hope made the difference. Hope, more than anything
                    else, helps us beat the odds when they’re stacked against
                    us.

                    Human beings desperately need hope. But how do we get
                    it? Hope is hard to find in our world-UNTIL we look at it
                    from the perspective of Bible prophecy. This DISCOVER

                        <p>
                            About five hundred years before the birth of Christ, God
                            gave the world a startling glimpse into the future through
                            the prophet Daniel. God presented an outline of world
                            history in advance for 2,500 years, from Daniel’s time to
                            our own day. This prophecy originated in a dream God
                            gave Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, some 2,500
                            years ago
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            T
                            he dream deeply troubled this monarch-but he
                            couldn’t remember the dream when he woke up! After
                            all of Babylon’s wise men failed to help the king recall
                            his dream or interpret it, a young Hebrew exile named
                            Daniel arrived on the scene, claiming that the God of
                            Heaven could reveal all mysteries.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Standing before the king, Daniel boldly declared:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            “You looked, O king, and there before you stood
                            A LARGE STATUE-an enormous, dazzling statue,
                            awesome in appearance.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            “The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest
                            and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, its legs
                            of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay.
                            “While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the
                            statue on its feet of iron and
                            clay and smashed them.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            “Then the iron, the clay, the
                            bronze, the silver and the gold
                            were broken to pieces at the
                            same time and became like
                            chaff on a threshing floor in
                            the summer. The wind swept
                            them away without leaving a
                            trace. But THE ROCK THAT
                            STRUCK THE TATUE
                            became a huge mountain
                            and FILLED THE WHOLE
                            EARTH.” - Daniel
                            2:31-35.

                    2. THE PROPHECY INTERPRETED
                </h2>

                <p>
                    After telling a very impressed Nebuchadnezzar exactly
                    what he’d seen in his vision, the prophet Daniel explained:
                </p>

                <p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
                    “This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the
                    king.” -Daniel 2:36.
                </p>

                <p>
                    THE HEAD OF GOLD: What world power did Daniel
                    tell the king the head of gold symbolized?
                </p>

                <p class="text-sm font-semibold italic">
                    “You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven
                    has given you dominion and power and might and
                    glory...YOU ARE THAT HEAD OF GOLD.” -Verses 37,
                    38.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Daniel was saying to the ruler of that world’s greatest
                    empire: “Nebuchadnezzar, God is telling you that your
                    empire, Babylon, is represented by the statue’s golden
                    head.” THE CHEST AND ARMS OF SILVER: From a
                    human perspective Babylon looked like an empire that
                    would last forever. But what does the prophecy say would
                    happen next?
                </p>

                <p class="text-sm font-semibold italic">
                    “After you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours.” -Verse 39.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In fulfillment of God’s prediction, Nebuchadnezzar’s
                    kingdom crumbled into ruins when Cyrus, the Persian
                    general, overthrew the Babylonian empire in 539 B.C.
                    So the chest and arms of silver represent Medo-Persia,
                    another mighty empire. THE BELLY AND THIGHS OF
                    BRONZE: What does this part of the great metal image
                    represent?
                </p>

                <p class="text-sm font-semibold italic">
                    “Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the
                    whole earth.” -Verse 39.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The belly and thighs of bronze of the image symbolize the
                    kingdom of Greece. Alexander the Great conquered the
                    Medes and the Persians, turning Greece into the world’s
                    third great empire. She ruled from 331 to 168 B.C.
                </p>

                <p>
                    THE LEGS OF IRON:
                </p>

                <p class="text-sm font-semibold italic">
                    “Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom [said the
                    prophet], strong as iron-for iron breaks and smashes
                    everything-and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will
                    crush and break all the others.” -Verse 40.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After the death of Alexander, his empire weakened and
                    split into rival factions until finally in 168 B.C., at the battle
                    of Pydna, the “Iron Empire” of Rome crushed Greece.
                    Caesar Augustus ruled the Roman Empire when Jesus
                    was born about two thousand years ago (Luke 2:1). Christ
                    and His apostles lived during the period represented by
                    the legs of iron. Gibbon, the eighteenthcentury historian,
                    no doubt had Daniel’s prophecy in mind when he wrote:
                    “The images of gold, or silver, or brass, that might serve
                    to represent the nations and their kings, were successively
                    broken by the iron monarchy of Rome.” -Edward Gibbon,
                    T
                    he History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire
                    (John D. Morris and Company), vol. 4, p. 89.
                </p>

                <p>
                    T
                    hink for a moment about this prediction from a human
                    point of view. How could Daniel, living in the time of
                    Babylon, have any idea of how many empires would
                    succeed each other hundreds of years in the future? We
                    have a hard time figuring out what the stock market is
                    going to do next week! And yet Babylon, Medo-Persia,
                    Greece, and Rome followed each other exactly as
                    predicted-like obedient schoolboys in a line. Is God in
                    control of the future? Can we have hope on the basis of
                    His grand plan? The answer is a resounding, Yes! THE
                    FEET AND TOES OF IRON MIXED WITH CLAY:
                    Would a fifth world power follow Rome?
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked
                    clay and partly of iron, so THIS WILL BE A DIVIDED
                    KINGDOM; yet it will have some of the strength of iron
                    in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay.
                </p>

                <p class="text-sm font-semibold italic">
                    As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this
                    kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.” -Daniel
                    2:41, 42.
                </p>

                <p>
                    T
                    he prophet predicted, not a fifth world empire, but a
                    division of the iron monarchy of Rome. Rome would fracture into ten kingdoms, as symbolized by the
                    feet and
                    toes of the image. Did this actually happen? It certainly
                    did.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During the fourth and fifth centuries of the Christian Era
                    barbaric invaders from the north poured down on the
                    decaying Roman Empire, delivering blow after blow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally ten of the tribes gained most of the territory of
                    Western Rome, and ten distinct, independent nations
                    established themselves within the boundaries of Europe.
                    T
                    hus the toes symbolize the modern nations of Europe
                    today.

                    REMAIN UNITED, any more than iron mixes with
                    clay.” -Daniel 2:43.

                    Over and over powerful men have tried to unite Europe,
                    but they fall short of the goal every time. Napoleon came
                    nearer than any other man to uniting a divided Europe,
                    but probably thinking of this prophecy, as he fled defeated
                    from the battlefield of Waterloo, he cried, “God Almighty
                    is too much for me!”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Kaiser Wilhelm II and Adolf Hitler created the most
                    powerful armed forces of their day. But each failed to
                    unite Europe under their rule. Why? Because God’s Word
                    was at stake: “The people will be a mixture and will not
                    remain united.” The outcome of two world wars confirm
                    that God holds the future in His hands; He is ultimately
                    in control. That’s certainly enough to give us hope, peace
                    of mind, and confidence in His plan for our lives.

                    Only one part of Daniel’s prophecy remains unfulfilled.
                    What is the meaning of the stone that strikes the statue
                    on the feet, grinds it to powder, and becomes a great
                    mountain which fills the whole earth?

                            “IN THE TIME OF THOSE KINGS [the modern nations
                            of Europe], THE GOD OF HEAVEN WILL SET UP A
                            KINGDOM that will never be destroyed, nor will it be
                            left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms
                            and bring them to an end, but IT WILL ITSELF
                            ENDURE FOREVER.” -Daniel 2:44.

                            “Those kings” could refer only to the kings symbolized
                            by the feet and toes of the statue-the rulers of modern
                            Europe, pointing to our day. The stone that is cut out
                            without human hands is to strike the statue and break it
                            into pieces, and will then fill the whole earth (verses 34,
                            35, 45). Soon Jesus will descend from heaven to “set up
                            a kingdom,” His kingdom of happiness and peace. Then
                            Christ, the Rock of Ages and the King of Kings, will rule
                            the world forever!

                    except the final act-the striking of the statue by the stone.
                    According to God’s timetable, we are now approaching
                    the grand climax, Christ’s return to our world.
                    Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is about to end the long,
                    bloody struggle of human history and establish His
                    eternal kingdom of love and grace.

                    his prophecy reveals the guiding hand of God in the
                    rise and fall of nations. God knows the past, and this
                    Bible prophecy clearly shows that He knows the future
                    as well. If God directs the movements of nations with
                    such precision, surely He can guide each individual’s life.
                    Jesus assured us: “Even the very hairs of your head are all
                    numbered. So don’t be afraid” (Matthew 10:30-31). God’s
                    gift of faith can become the antidote to all our worries
                    and fears. The hope He inspires can serve as an anchor
                    for our souls (Hebrews 6:19).

                    he sixteenth-century scholar Erasmus related an incident during a sea voyage that stayed with him
                    the rest
                    of his life. His sailing vessel ran aground in a storm. As
                    violent waves smashed against the ship and it began to
                    break up, even the sailors panicked. The passengers were
                    near hysteria. Most shouted for help to their patron saint,
                    sang hymns, or pleaded loudly in prayer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Erasmus noted one passenger, however, who acted very
                    differently. “Of all of us,” Erasmus wrote, “the one who
                    remained most composed was a young woman who was
                    holding a baby whom she was nursing. She was the only
                    one who did not shout, weep, or bargain with Heaven.
                    She did nothing but pray quietly to herself while clasping
                    the baby tightly on her lap.”

                            his prayer, Erasmus realized, was just a continuation of
                            her regular prayer life. She seemed to entrust herself to
                            God.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As the ship began to sink, this young mother was placed
                            on a plank, given a spar to use as an oar, and sent out into
                            the waves. She had to hold her baby with one hand and
                            attempt to row with the other. Few thought she would
                            survive the pounding surf.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But her faith and composure stood her in good stead. The
                            woman and her child were the first to reach shore.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Hope in a trustworthy God can make all the difference
                            even when our world seems to be breaking up around us.
                            We’re not out there paddling on our own. A greater hand
                            is guiding us and holding us up.

                            If you will come to Christ in full surrender, He will give
                            you a faith that will see you through every storm.
