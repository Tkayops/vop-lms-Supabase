					Most of us have an almost instinctive urge to
					peek into the future. We want to know what lies
					beyond the horizon. But accurate predictions
					remain terribly elusive. We have a difficult enough time
					forecasting tomorrow’s weather! There is Someone,
					however, whose prophecies have proven remarkably
					accurate. Jesus Christ, through His Word, can take us
					into the future; He’s a reliable guide. In this lesson we’re
					going to look at what He had to say about His second
					coming. After all, who could know more about the end of
					the world than the One who created it in the beginning?

					1. SIGNS THAT CHRIST WILL RETURN IN OUR
					DAY
				</h2>

				<p>
					After Jesus assured His disciples that He would come
					back to our world a second time (Matthew 23:39), what
					question did they ask Him?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“’Tell us,’ they said, ‘when will this happen, and what
					will be THE SIGN OF YOUR COMING and of the end
					of the age?’”-Matthew 24:3. (Unless otherwise noted, all
					Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the
					New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)
				</p>

				<p>
					Jesus answered clearly and positively. In chapter 24 of
					Matthew and chapter 21 of Luke He personally gave
					several “signs,” or evidences, by which we can know
					when His coming is near. Other Bible prophecies help
					f
					ill out the picture, detailing world conditions just before
					Christ’s return. As we’ll see, these prophecies are being
					fulfilled before our very eyes; they indicate that Christ’s
					coming back to earth is near at hand.
				</p>

				<p>
					Let’s look at ten signposts of Bible prophecy along the
					highway to heaven, and examine the questions that a
					modern-day traveler might ask as he reads them.
				</p>

				<div class="space-y-3">
					<h5 class="font-semibold">Signpost 1-Anguish! Terror! Perplexity!</h5>
					<p>
						Over nineteen hundred years ago Jesus gave a prophetic
						description of contemporary life that sounds as if it could
						have been taken from the evening news:
					</p>

					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“There will be SIGNS in the sun, moon and stars. On
						the earth, NATIONS WILL BE IN ANGUISH AND
						PERPLEXITY at the roaring and tossing of the sea.
						MEN WILL FAINT FROM TERROR, APPREHENSIVE
						OF WHAT IS COMING ON THE WORLD, for the
						heavenly bodies will be shaken. AT THAT TIME THEY
						WILL SEE THE SON OF MAN COMING in a cloud
						with power and great glory. When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your
						heads, because
						your redemption is drawing near.” -Luke 21:25-28.
					</p>

					<p>
						No more accurate description of today’s world could be
						penned than: “Men will faint from terror, apprehensive
						of what is coming on the world.” Stockpiled weapons are
						capable of destroying the entire planet. What if some
						terrorist gets a nuclear warhead?
					</p>

					<p>
						Jesus gives us a basis for hope in a calamitous age.
						T
						he current crisis of global “anguish and perplexity”
						only reinforces the truth that Christ’s coming really is
						“drawing near.” People today often moan in frustration,
						“Look what the world has come to!” But the student of
						Bible prophecy can exclaim with hopeful voice, “Look
						WHO is coming to our world.”
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="space-y-3">
					<h5 class="font-semibold">Signpost 2-World Calamities.</h5>
					<p>
						How do natural disasters fit into last-day events?
					</p>

					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“There will be great EARTHQUAKES, FAMINES and
						PESTILENCES in various places, and fearful events and
						great signs from heaven. . . .When you see these things
						happening, you know that THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS
						NEAR.” -Luke 21:11, 31.
					</p>

					<p>
						T
						hink about famines for a moment. Images of starving
						kids with distended bellies persist on the news.
					</p>

					<p>
						Isn’t it rather amazing that a world which can send men
						to the moon, CANNOT feed all its people? Jesus knew
						that famines would persist, that selfish human nature
						would grow worse toward the end of time.
					</p>

					<p>
						But what about earthquakes? According to the World
						Almanac of 1999, in century after century of the
						Christian era there has been a striking increase in major
						earthquakes: 18th century 6 major earthquakes, 19th
						century 7, 20th century more than 100. So the evidence
						grows more dramatic as we get nearer and nearer to our
						present day.
					</p>

					<p>
						These figures confirm Jesus’ prophecy. Famines and major
						earthquakes are reaching a crescendo-- “the kingdom of
						God is near!” Will our 21st century bring hundreds more
						major earthquakes, or the coming of the King of Kings?
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="space-y-3">
					<h5 class="font-semibold">Signpost 3-Accumulating Wealth.</h5>
					<p>
						What is the meaning of wealth slipping into the hands of
						fewer and fewer while more and more fall into poverty?
					</p>

					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“You have hoarded wealth in the last days.” -James 5:3.
					</p>

					<p>
						Despite all our economic insights, the rich keep getting icher and the poor poorer. The
						multi-million dollar
						fortunes are another signpost that show us “the Lord’s
						coming is near” (verse 8).
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="space-y-3">
					<h5 class="font-semibold"> Signpost 4-Civil Unrest.</h5>
					<p>
						Why have discontent and unrest among employees risen
						so dramatically?
					</p>

					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“Look! The wages you failed to pay the workmen who
						mowed your fields are crying out against you. THE
						CRIES OF THE HARVESTERS [WORKERS] have
						reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. Be patient and
						stand firm, because THE LORD’S COMING IS NEAR.” -James 5:4, 8.
					</p>

					<p>
						After predicting an unparalleled piling up of wealth in our
						day, James foresaw civil unrest arising from discontented
						workers. The tension between the “haves” and the “have
						not’s” continues to increase. Another sign that “the Lord’s
						coming is near.”
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="space-y-3">
					<h5 class="font-semibold"> Signpost 5-Moral Decay. </h5>
					<p>
						Why does the moral fiber of society seem to be shredding?
					</p>

					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“But mark this: There will be TERRIBLE TIMES IN THE
						LAST DAYS. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers
						of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their
						parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving,
						slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of
						the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure
						rather than lovers of God-having a form of godliness
						but denying its power...EVIL MEN AND IMPOSTORS
						WILL GO FROM BAD TO WORSE, deceiving and
						being deceived.” -2 Timothy 3:1-5, 13
					</p>

					<p>
						Could anyone think of a more accurate description of
						our world? Point a camera in any direction these days
						and you’ll catch a picture of arrogant materialism.
						You’ll capture a shocking epidemic of child abuse and
						molestation. You’ll get countless scenes of youth out of
						control, kids in their early teens killing and maiming at
						random. All these things form a gallery of pictures loudly
						proclaiming that Jesus’ coming is very near.
					</p>

				<div class="space-y-3">
					<h5 class="font-semibold"> Signpost 6-Spread of the Occult. </h5>
					<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4 gap-6">

							</div>
						</div>


						<div class="col-span-3">

							<p>
								Why are we seeing an explosion of interest in the occult?
							</p>

							<p class="italic text-sm font-semibold">
								“For false Christs and false prophets will appear and
								perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the
								elect-if that were possible.” -Matthew 24:24.
							</p>

							<p>
								These passages predict that the time of the end will feature
								all kinds of miracles and signs, a counterfeit manifestation
								of the supernatural. Witches and warlocks appear on talk
								shows. New Agers are everywhere, selling magic crystals
								and channeling departed spirits. Counterfeit signs and
								wonders are booming. All this makes it even clearer that
								just as Jesus predicted, we are living in the time of “the
								coming of the Son of Man” (verse 27).
							</p>

						</div>



					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="space-y-3">
					<h5 class="font-semibold"> Signpost 7-An Awakened World. </h5>
					<p>
						What is the meaning of the awakening to world
						consciousness of Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe,
						and the nations of the Far East?
					</p>

					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“’LET THE NATIONS BE ROUSED;...Swing the sickle,
						for the harvest is ripe...so great is their wickedness!’
						Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For
						THE DAY OF THE LORD IS NEAR in the valley of
						decision.” -Joel 3:12-14.
					</p>

					<p>
						Today in Asia and Africa, Eastern Europe, the former
						Soviet Union, and Middle Eastern countries, we are
						witnessing perhaps the most widespread awakening of
						individual nations in all of recorded history, “for the day
						of the Lord is near.”
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="space-y-3">
					<h5 class="font-semibold"> Signpost 8-Peace Plans and War Preparations.</h5>
					<p>
						We live in a strange world. Everyone agrees that we
						should give peace a chance. We talk peace; yet pent up
						hostilities, some centuries old, flare into open conflict.
						T
						he prophets Micah and Joel predicted that at the very
						time the nations talk about their desire for peace (Micah
						4:1-3), distrust for their neighbors compels them to
						prepare for war (Joel 3:9-13).
					</p>


					<p>
						Long ago the Bible pictured our present peace-war
						dilemma, and declared that permanent peace will reign
						on earth only when Jesus comes.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="space-y-3">
					<h5 class="font-semibold"> Signpost 9-Modern Progress.</h5>
					<p>
						Why, after centuries of human history have transportation
						and communication brought the world so close together?
					</p>

					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“UNTIL THE TIME OF THE END, many will go here
						and there to increase knowledge.” -Daniel 12:4.
					</p>


					<p>
						Daniel here indicates that knowledge of his prophecies
						would increase “in” (KJV), or “until the time of the end.”
						But this prediction also seems to point straight to our
						computerized information age. Knowledge of all kinds
						has increased at lightning speed these past few years.
						T
						here have been more changes in the past fifty years than
						in the previous two thousand.
					</p>

					<p>
						“MANY WILL GO HERE AND THERE to increase
						knowledge.” Before 1850, people moved around by horse
						and buggy, pretty much as they had from the beginning of time. Now we break the sound barrier
						and span the globe
						in everything from Concorde airplanes to space shuttles.
						Increased travel and the recent flood of inventions give
						further evidence that we’re living in “the time of the end.”

								For decades almost half the globe was locked behind an
								iron curtain, shut away from the Good News. But then
								almost overnight Eastern Europe slipped from the iron

								down, and the mighty Soviet Empire fell apart. Suddenly
								roughly half the planet was opening its arms to the gospel
							</p>

							<p>
								T

					2. HOW SOON WILL JESUS COME?
				</h2>

				<p>
					After describing the events that were to characterize the
					time just preceding His second coming, Jesus concludes
					His remarks by saying,
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly
					not pass away until all these things have happened.” - Matthew 24:34
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he conclusion is obvious-the generation portrayed by
					these signposts of prophecy will see Jesus return to earth
					a second time. It won’t be long until He’ll sweep away
					sin and suffering, and establish His everlasting kingdom.
					Jesus cautions, “No one knows...that day or hour” (verse
					36).
				</p>

				<p>
					And Jesus continues:
				</p>

				<p class="text-sm font-semibold italic">
					“You also must be ready, because the Son of Man
					will come at an hour when you do not expect him.” - Matthew 24:44
				</p>



			</div>


			<!-- section 3 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					3. JESUS, THE WORLD’S ONLY HOPE
				</h2>

				<p>
					Christ is the last, best hope for our world because only
					He can deal with the very thing that is destroying it sin.
				</p>

				<p>
					Jesus died on Calvary to make possible the defeat of
					evil and deliverance for all who respond to His offer of
					salvation.
				</p>

				<p class="font-semibold italic text-sm">
					“He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the
					devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason
					the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s
					work.” -1 John 3:8.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our Savior created a way out of our crumbling world by
					sacrificing His own flesh and blood. And the same Jesus,
					who will someday cure all the world’s ills by destroying
					sin, offers right now to erase the guilt of sin from your
					life. You don’t have to wait for the Second Coming to
					f
					ind release from guilt, and from anxiety and destructive
					behavior. Jesus is quite willing to give you His kind of
					peace this very moment.
				</p>


				<p>
					While attending a religious meeting a young woman felt
					strangely moved by the gospel presentation. As she heard
					the story of a soon-coming Savior unfold, all the pieces
					began to fit into place. This made sense. She decided that
					she’d been looking for love, happiness, and peace in all
					the wrong places. Jesus had to be the answer.
				</p>
				<p>
					T
					he next day when the evangelist and his associate went
					to see her, she poured out the story of a bitter and broken
					life. She’d sunk to the bottom as an alcoholic, and was
					supporting herself through prostitution. After describing
					her problems, she sobbed out, “You were really speaking
					to me last night.” But the voice that had reached her heart
					was the voice of God. And He was speaking tenderly. She
					decided to lay it all on the line. She invited Christ to come
					into her heart as Savior and Lord, and fastened onto the
					hope of His soon return.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the weeks that followed, she began to notice that her
					many fears and insecurities, which she’d always tried to
					drown in drink, now found release as she spent time
					communicating with Jesus. He began to deliver her from
					the compulsions that had been wrecking her life.
				</p>
				<p>
					She had done a lot of things she wasn’t proud of. But
					Christ’s grace and forgiveness proved stronger than her
					shame. The experience of the thief on the cross meant
					a lot to her. In his last, desperate hours he turned to
					the Innocent Sufferer beside him and asked,
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Jesus,
					remember me when you come into your kingdom”
					(Luke 23:42).
				</p>

				<p>
					Jesus immediately answered by promising the thief a
					place with Him in paradise (verse 43). The same Jesus
					who graciously offered forgiveness to that dying thief,
					now offers you salvation, complete pardon, and peace of
					mind. Discover it for yourself today. You too can pray
					with the dying thief: “Jesus, remember me when you
					come into your kingdom.” And Jesus will answer, “I will
					come again, and you will be with Me in paradise.”
