					Ramon Umashankar was born a Brahmin. His elders
					taught him at an early age that he was a god, and
					that to realize his divinity he must practice yoga and
					meditation. But as a teenager, Ramon began to wonder if He
					could really find God through the various idols worshipped in
					Hindu temples.
				</p>

				<p>
					Ramon began examining the Bible and the claims of Christ. He
					had always respected Jesus for His humility, but now Ramon
					heard that this Jesus claimed to be the unique Son of God.
					And he noticed that many Christians seemed to have a peace
					that years of meditation failed to produce. Still, Ramon was
					determined to find truth in his own Hindu religion.
				</p>

				<p>
					But then he saw a film on the life of Christ. For the first time
					he realized that Jesus had experienced suffering and fear as a
					human being. Previous to this he thought Jesus had somehow
					used His supernatural powers to escape the pain of crucifixion.
					But now, he couldn’t explain the cross. He wondered: How did
					this Jesus go through such an ordeal-for sinful men?
				</p>

				<p>
					As Ramon continued to meditate on Christ’s death, he was
					overwhelmed by such a demonstration of love. He decided to
					give up his coveted Brahmin status and turn his life over to
					Jesus, the Savior. In comparison with Christ’s sacrificial love,
					Ramon said, “Everything else just fell to pieces.”
					T
					his young Brahmin discovered the central truth of
					Christianity: Jesus, the Savior of the world.

					1. WHICH RELIGION SAVES?
				</h2>

				<p>
					Jesus is the Way-the only way-of salvation.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name
					under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.” -Acts 4:12. (Unless otherwise noted, all
					Scriptural texts in the
					DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of
					the Bible [NIV].)
				</p>

				<p>
					The Bible clearly teaches that we are lost in sin, and thus subject
					to sin’s penalty: death (Romans 6:23). All have sinned (Romans
					3:23), so all face death. And Jesus is the One-the only One-who
					can rescue us from sin’s condemnation.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have
					eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.” -John 6:40.

					2. DOES GOD HAVE A SPECIAL MESSAGE FOR LAST
					DAY CHRISTIANS?
				</h2>
				<p>
					Yes. This threefold message appears in Revelation 14:6-16. The
					proclamation of messages given by these three angels climaxes
					with the second coming of Christ (Verses 14-16)
				</p>

				<div class="space-y-3 ml-6">
					<div>
						<p> (1) The First Angel’s Message.</p>
						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“Then I saw another angel [messenger] flying in midair, and
							he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the
							earth-to every nation, tribe, language and people. He said in a
							loud voice, ‘Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of
							his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens,
							the earth, the sea and the springs of water.’” -Revelation 14:6, 7.

								<p>
									hough Scripture dramatically portrays these three messages
									through the symbol of three angels, God’s people are the
									messengers who actually deliver them to the world. They do
									not proclaim a new gospel, but “the eternal gospel” to the
									entire world-”to every nation, tribe, language and people.” “The
									eternal gospel” of Jesus is the same message of salvation that
									people in Old Testament times accepted “by faith” (Hebrews
									3:16-19; 4:2; 11:1-40); the same teaching that Jesus Himself
									proclaimed; the same gospel the disciples preached to conquer
									the world for Christ; the same gospel that has thundered down
									through the centuries of the Christian era.
								</p>

								<p>
									The simple, saving gospel of Jesus Christ almost vanished from
									the church for more than a thousand years during the Dark
									Ages, but the Reformation revived it, and God’s people preach
									it around the world today. The first angel proclaims this same
									gospel message, but it is given in a new setting-a worldwide
									one-for people living just before Jesus comes a second time.
								</p>

								</div>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>
							Those who accept this message find themselves called to “fear
							God and give him glory [reflect His character].” They show
							the world God’s character of love, not only by their words, but
						</p>

						<p>
							also by their lives of dynamic witness. They offer a thrilling
							revelation of what God can do through people filled with the
							Spirit of Christ.
						</p>

						<p>
							When are these three angels’ messages to be proclaimed
							throughout the world? When the hour of God’s “judgment has
							come.” Guide 13 explains that Jesus began the work of His pre
							advent judgment in 1844. In that very year, 1844, Jesus inspired
							people all over the world to begin preaching the message of
							Revelation 14.
						</p>

						<p>
							This message calls for us to “worship him who made the
							heavens, [and] the earth” (Revelation 14:7). God asks us to
							“remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy” because “in
							six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth” (Exodus
							20:8-11). In 1844 when Darwin was propounding the theory
							of evolution, God was calling people back to worship Him as
							the Creator. At this very time, those preaching the three angels’
							messages discovered the seventh-day Sabbath of God’s Word
							and began to keep it in honor of the Creator of heaven and
							earth.
						</p>


					</div>

					<div>
						<p>
							(2) The Second Angel’s Message.
						</p>

						<p>
							“A second angel followed and said, ‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon
							the Great, which made all nations drink the maddening wine
							of her adulteries.’” -Revelation 14:8.
						</p>

						<p>
							The second angel warns, “fallen is Babylon the Great.” Revelation
							17 depicts spiritual “Babylon”-apostate Christianity-as an
							immoral woman (Verse 5). She stands in contrast to the pure
							woman of Revelation 12 who represents the true Christian
							church. The woman who represents Babylon is a fallen woman
							who “made all nations drink the maddening wine of her
							adulteries.” The wine of false doctrine has permeated these
							adulterated forms of Christianity. The message of the second
							angel calls God’s people to resist the false teachings of an
							apostate Christianity.
						</p>

						<p>
							Babylon represents a mixture of many forms of apostate
							Christianity. She is so dangerous because she distorts the picture
							of God into caricatures: God as vengeful and demanding, or
							God as a sentimental grandparent who’s too sweet to bother
							anyone about sin. A healthy church will present a balanced
							picture of all God’s attributes and show how His justice and
							mercy combine in the truth that God is love.
						</p>

						<p>
							God calls people to “come out” of Babylon (Revelation 18:4), to
							reject unbiblical teachings, and follow Christ’s teachings.

							(3) The Third Angel’s Message.

								</div>
							</div>

							<div class="col-span-3 space-y-2 text-justify  md:px-0">
								<p>
									“A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: ‘If anyone
									worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the
									forehead or on the hand, he, too, will drink of the wine of God’s
									fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his
									wrath. . . . There is no rest day or night for those who worship
									the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark
									of his name.’ This calls for patient endurance on the part of the
									saints who obey God’s commandments and remain faithful to
									Jesus.” -Revelation 14:9-12.
								</p>
								<p>
									The third angel’s message divides the entire world into two
									groups. On one side stand the apostate Christians who
									“worship the beast and his image and receive his mark on the
									forehead or on the hand.” On the other side stand those who
									reject the authority of the beast, “the saints who obey God’s
									commandments and remain faithful to Jesus.”
								</p>
								<p>
									Note the contrast between the two opposing groups. Those who receive the mark of the
									beast
									are compromising worshipers
									who follow convenient man-made ideas and practices. The
									“saints” have as their distinguishing traits: “patient endurance,”
									obedience to “God’s commandments,” and they “remain
									faithful to Jesus.”
								</p>


							</div>


						</div>

						<p>
							After these threefold messages have been spread throughout the world, Jesus will
							come to “harvest” the saved:
						</p>

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated
							on the cloud was one ‘like a son of man’ with a crown of gold
							on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. Then another angel
							came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who
							was sitting on the cloud, ‘Take your sickle and reap, because
							the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.’
							So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the
							earth, and the earth was harvested.” -Revelation 14:14-16.

					3. CHRIST’S LAST-DAY CHURCH
				</h2>

				<p>
					Have you admired a strong, stable Christian, marveled at his
					or her devotion, patience, and faith, and longed for a similar
					spiritual experience? God gave His special message for our day
					in Revelation 14 because it can produce just such an experience.
				</p>

				<p>
					As discussed in Guide 25, Revelation 12:17 identifies last-day
					Christians as “those who obey God’s commandments and hold
					to the testimony of Jesus.” Revelation 14:12 describes this same
					group as “saints who obey God’s commandments and remain
					faithful to Jesus.”
				</p>


				<p>
					Let’s summarize the characteristics of last-day Christians.
				</p>
				<div class="space-y-3 ml-6">
					<p>
						(1) They “hold to the testimony of Jesus.” Even when Satan
						vents His anger against them, they “remain faithful to Jesus.”
						Their faith is not of their own making, it’s a gift from God
						(Ephesians 2:8). God’s last-day church see Christ more and
						more clearly in His true character and by grace through faith
						they become living monuments to the power of an indwelling
						Christ.
					</p>
					<p>
						(2) They “keep . . . the faith of Jesus” (Revelation 14:12, KJV).
						The faith that Jesus had, the faith that He taught, the faith that He lived, now fills their
						hearts. They not only have the
						truth, they “keep” the truth-they follow it. To them religion
						is life, belief is correlated with practice, and faith is coupled
						with obedience. They live out “the faith of Jesus.” They have
						discovered that the great teachings of the Bible, when applied
						to daily living, produce a dynamic Christian life. They have
						found that these great Bible truths awaken a love and devotion
						to Christ that satisfies every need and longing of the human
						heart
					</p>
					<p>
						(3)
						T
						hey “obey God’s commandments”-the Ten
						Commandments, the moral law of God. They want
						above all else to obey God’s every wish, His every
						command. They show their love to God and love to
						other people by following all the commandments of
						God, including the fourth commandment that directs
						us to worship our Creator by honoring Saturday, the
						seventh-day Sabbath.
					</p>
					<p>
						(4) They share the message of “the eternal gospel” throughout
						the world (Revelation 14:6). The gospel declares that
						Jesus died for our sins, then rose from the grave so we
						can experience a saving relationship with Him. Christ’s
						last-day church has been calling people everywhere to
						come out of religious confusion and form a relationship
						with Jesus based solely on Bible truth.
					</p>

					<p>
						(5) They are driven by a sense of urgency because “the time
						to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe”
						(Revelation 14:15), and millions still haven’t found
						Christ.
					</p>

					<p>
						(6) They are consumed by their God-given mission. Because
						“Babylon the Great” is fallen, they plead with those
						still living in religious confusion, “Come out of her, my
						people” (Revelation 18:4). They desire to share their
						wonderful relationship with Christ and their happiness
						with everyone else.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					All this and more unites the hearts of the millions of last-day
					Christians called out by the three angels’ messages. Their life
					of joy leads them to join the apostle John in extending this
					invitation to you
				</p>


				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that
					you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is
					with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. We write this
					to make your joy complete.” -1 John 1:3, 4, margin.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					hrough His Spirit and through His church, Jesus invites you
					also to come and surrender everything to Him:
				</p>
				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“The Spirit and the bride [church] say, ‘Come!’ And let him
					who hears say, ‘Come!’ Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and
					whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.” -Revelation 22:17.
				</p>

				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					4. THE TWO HARVESTS
				</h2>

				<p>
					The three angels’ messages culminate when Jesus returns to
					earth to harvest the saved of all time (Revelation 14:14-16).
					Jesus gathers all the saved and transports them to His “many
					mansions” in heaven (John 14:1-3, KJV). He abolishes for all
					time sin, sickness, misery, and death. The saints begin glorious
					new lives with Him throughout eternity (Revelation 21:1-4).
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus will also “harvest” the wicked at His coming.
				</p>
				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle. Still another angel
					. . . called in a loud
					voice to him who had the sharp sickle, ‘Take your sharp sickle
					and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth’s vine, because
					its grapes are ripe.’ The angel swung his sickle on the earth,
					gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of
					God’s wrath. They were trampled in the winepress outside the
					city, and blood flowed out of the press.” -Revelation 14:17-20.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					his will be a tragic time of final destruction, a very sorrowful
					event for Christ because He must destroy those who refuse
					to be saved. Jesus “is patient with you, not wanting anyone to
					perish, but everyone to come to repentance” (2 Peter 3:9).
				</p>

				<p>
					When Jesus comes to reap the harvest of earth, in which
					harvest will you be? Will you stand among the ripened grain
					with the redeemed of all ages (Revelation 14:13-16)? Or will
					you be among ripened grapes of wrath with the lost (verses
					17-20)?
				</p>
				<p>
					T
					he issue is clearly set. On the one side, Jesus stands with
					outstretched nail-pierced hands, urging you to take your stand
					with the “saints who obey God’s commandments and keep the
					faith of Jesus” (verse 12). On the other side are the voices of
					mere human beings, urging that obedience to the entire Bible
					and to all the commandments of God is not important.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he crowd in Pilate’s judgment hall once faced a strikingly
					similar issue. On the one hand was Jesus, the divine-human
					God-man. On the other hand was Barabbas, a helpless man,
					unable to help himself or those in the crowd who witnessed
					that tragic scene. And yet when the commanding words of
					Pilate rang through the motley crowd, “Which of the two shall
					I release unto you?” the multitude of voices thundered back in
					angry tones, “Barabbas!”
				</p>

				<p>
					“What then,” asked Pilate, “shall I do with Jesus, the so-called
					Christ?”
				</p>

				<p>
					With one voice the crowd shouted, “Let Him be crucified!”
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					And so Jesus, the innocent One, was crucified; and Barabbas,
					the guilty one, went free. (See Matthew 27:20-26.)
				</p>

				<p>
					Whom do you choose today, Barabbas or Jesus? Do you choose
					to follow man-made ideas and teachings that are contrary to
					the commandments of God and contrary to the eternal gospel
					of Jesus? Or do you desire to “obey God’s commandments and
					remain faithful to Jesus”? Remember, Jesus is the One who
					promises to send His Holy Spirit to solve your every perplexity,
					to heal your every heartache, and to satisfy your every longing.
