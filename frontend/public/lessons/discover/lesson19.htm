					Here is a thrilling letter from one of our Bible school
					representatives in Africa:
					“Five years ago I received a request from the
					Voice of Prophecy to visit a prisoner who was a Bible
					correspondence school student. I presented the request to
					the prison authorities, who graciously gave permission.
					Because the student had a deep desire to study the Bible,
					I visited him regularly
				</p>

				<p>
					“About six months after my initial visit, he asked to be
					baptized and join the church. The authorities agreed to
					provide facilities so the baptism could take place in the
					prison. The wardens and other prisoners gathered to
					witness one of the most moving baptisms I have ever
					conducted.
				</p>

				<p>
					“Shortly after this, our brother was released from jail,
					even though he still had considerable time to serve.
					When I asked why, I was told that his life had changed
					so drastically, and he was such a witness for his Savior
					and his religion that he could no longer be thought of as
					a prisoner, nor be treated as such. This man was united
					with his family and is now a leader in one of our large
					congregations.

					1. WHAT IS THE MEANING OF BAPTISM?
				</h2>

				<p>
					When this prisoner became a Christian and his life
					completely changed, why was it important for him to
					be baptized? In a conversation with Nicodemus, the
					community leader who came to Jesus by night, Jesus
					makes clear the importance and meaning of baptism:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“No one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born
					again . . . unless he is born of water and the Spirit.” -John
					3:3, 5. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in
					the DISCOVER guides are from the New International
					Version of the Bible [NIV].)
				</p>

				<p>
					So according to Jesus we must be born “of water and the
					Spirit.” “Born of the Spirit” signifies entering a new life by
					undergoing a change of mind and heart.
				</p>

				<p>
					Because entering the kingdom of God involves a
					completely new kind of existence, not just an old life
					patched up, it is called the new birth. Water baptism is
					the outward symbolic portrayal of this inward change.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our representative baptized the prisoner as a recognition
					of his commitment to Christ and as a symbol of the
					transformation the Holy Spirit had begun in his character
				</p>

			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					2. WHY SHOULD I BE BAPTIZED?
				</h2>
				<p>
					Our salvation revolves around three of Christ’s great acts:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Christ DIED for our sins according to the Scriptures, .
					. . he was BURIED, . . . he was RAISED on the third day
					according to the Scriptures.” -1 Corinthians 15:3, 4.
				</p>

				<p>
					Christ made salvation possible through His death, burial,
					and resurrection.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into
					Christ Jesus were BAPTIZED INTO HIS DEATH?
					We were therefore BURIED WITH HIM THROUGH
					BAPTISM into death in order that, JUST AS CHRIST
					WAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD through the glory
					of the Father, WE TOO MAY LIVE A NEW LIFE.” -
					Romans 6:3, 4.
				</p>

				<p>
					Christ died for our sins, was buried, then rose from the
					grave to give us a new life of righteousness. By being
					baptized we actually participate in the death, burial, and
					resurrection of Jesus. Baptism means that we have died to
					sin with Christ, buried the old life of sin with Christ, and
					we are rising to “live a new life” in Christ. Christ’s death
					and resurrection becomes our death and resurrection.
					God can make us dead to sin, as if we’d been crucified.
					He can make us alive to the things of the Spirit, as if we’d
					been resurrected from the dead.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he physical act of baptism graphically represents the
					steps of conversion. First, we’re lowered into the water,
					we’re immersed completely, just as people who have died
					are lowered into the grave and covered. This says we
					are willing to die with Christ and bury our old lifestyle.
					Baptism is a funeral, a formal farewell to an existence
					in which sin dominated. Then, we’re lifted up out of
					the water by the one baptizing, just like a person being
					resurrected from the grave.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					his says that we’re a “new creation,” entirely given to the
					“new life” God gives us. Only immersion can accurately
					illustrate the true meaning of baptism-death, burial,
					and rebirth. “Baptism” by sprinkling doesn’t adequately
					symbolize the new birth.
				</p>

				<p>
					What does it really mean to die with Christ?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“For we know that our old self was crucified with him
					so that the body of sin might be done away with [be
					rendered powerless, margin] that we should no longer
					be slaves to sin.” -Romans 6:6.
				</p>

				<p>
					Baptism represents outwardly what a person must
					do inside: surrender everything to Christ. If we hold
					anything back from God, then we’ll likely remain “slaves
					to sin.” When we surrender fully to Christ, our sinful
					desires are “rendered powerless,” and our transformation
					begins.
				</p>

				<p>
					Who is responsible for the change that takes place?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live,
					but CHRIST LIVES IN ME. The life I live in the body, I
					LIVE BY FAITH IN THE SON OF GOD, who loved me
					and gave himself for me.” -Galatians 2:20.
				</p>

				<p>
					When I identify with Christ’s crucifixion through
					baptism, I invite a powerful force into my life-”Christ
					lives in me.”
				</p>
				<p>

					In order to put your life fully in Christ’s hands, first look
					at
				</p>
				<p>
					Christ dying on the cross. Don’t look at the sin that’s
					threatening you, don’t look at your past record and moan;
					look to Jesus. Viewing Christ’s gracious and courageous
					death at Calvary, you can express solidarity with Him:
					“By the power of the cross I claim that I am dead to old
					habits and responsive to God. I make my stand with
					Christ. From now on I will ‘live by faith in the Son of
					God, who loved me and gave himself for me.’”
				</p>

				<p>
					As we tap into the power of Christ’s death and resurrection
					we see more and more of His good qualities replacing our
					old habits:
				</p>
				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“If anyone is IN CHRIST, he is A NEW CREATION;
					the OLD has gone, the NEW has come!” -2 Corinthians
					5:17.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					hrough baptism we express our desire to lock arms with
					Jesus and live a new and better life “in Christ.” Jesus does
					in us what we could never do for ourselves. We arise from
					the water “a new creation”; He gives us the power to live
					a “new” life.

						<p>
							At Pentecost, Peter

							seeking release from
							guilt to “repent and be
							baptized” so Christ can
							forgive “your sins” (Acts
							2:38). Since Jesus never
							committed a single sin,
							Why did He permit

						</p>

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“Then JESUS CAME

							BAPTIZED by John .
							. . TO FULFILL ALL
							RIGHTEOUSNESS.” -Matthew 3:13, 15
						</p>

						<p>
							Jesus was sinless. He didn’t need to repent of any
							sin. He was baptized for another reason: “to fulfill all
							righteousness.”
						</p>

						<p>
							By being baptized, Jesus set a positive example for us weak,
							sinful human beings. Christ never asks His followers
							to go anywhere He hasn’t been. So when believers are immersed in the waters of baptism, they
							are following in
							the steps of the Master.

						</p>

						<p>

							Because Christ died for our sins, He can give us His
							righteousness.
						</p>

						<p>
							“God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that

							Corinthians 5:21.
						</p>

					</div>


				</div>

				<p>
					Transformed in God’s eyes from sinners into saints, we
					grow into that “righteousness,” and thus we live a new
					life in Christ.

			<!-- section 4 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					4. WHY SHOULD I BE IMMERSED?
				</h2>

				<p>
					Christ was immersed at His baptism; He was not
					sprinkled with water. John baptized Him in the Jordan
					River “because there was PLENTY OF WATER” (John
					3:23). When Jesus was baptized, He went down into the
					water, and “as soon as Jesus was baptized [immersed,
					Greek], he went UP OUT OF THE WATER” (Matthew
					3:16).
				</p>

				<p>
					When we understand the true meaning of baptism, we
					have
					little difficulty recognizing the authentic form of baptism.
					T
					he very word “baptize” comes from the Greek word
					baptizo, and means to dip or immerse (put under)
				</p>
				<p>
					During John Wesley’s visit to America in 1737, a church
					jury of 34 men tried him on the strange charge of
					“refusing to baptize Mr. Parker’s child, except by dipping.”
					It’s evident that the father of Methodism baptized his
					converts by immersion. The reformer John Calvin stated:
					“It is certain that immersion was the practice of the
					ancient Church.” - Institutes of the Christian Religion,
					Bk. 4, Chap. 15, Sec. 19.
				</p>
				<p>
					T
					he history of the early church makes clear that baptism
					meant immersion. Dean Stanley, of the Church of
					England, wrote: “For the first thirteen centuries, the
					almost universal practice of baptism was that of which
					we read in the New Testament, and which is the very
					meaning of the word ‘baptize’-that those who were
					baptized were plunged, submerged, immersed into the
					water.”-Christian Institutions, p. 21.
				</p>
				<p>
					Baptistries for immersing converts appear in many of
					the churches which were built between the fourth and
					fourteenth centuries in Europe and Asia, churches like
					the cathedral in Pisa, Italy, and St. John’s, the largest
					church in Rome. It was not until the Council of Ravenna
					early in the fifteenth century that the Catholic Church
					accepted sprinkling as equally valid with immersion. In
					questions of church practice, we are not to follow what
					a man teaches, but what Christ and His apostles teach.
					Many sincere Christians cherish the tradition of infant
					baptism, and giving our children to God from the very
					beginning is certainly commendable.
				</p>
				<p>
					T
					he Bible, however, makes it clear that a person must
					be taught the way of salvation before baptism (Matthew 28:19, 20), that a person must believe in
					Jesus before
					being baptized (Acts 8:35- 38), and that a person must
					repent of sin and be forgiven before being baptized (Acts
					2:38). A baby is incapable of believing, repentance, or
					confession, which must precede baptism.
				</p>

			<!-- section 5 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					5. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO BE BAPTIZED?
				</h2>

				<p>
					According to Jesus, baptism is essential for those who
					wish to enter heaven:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“No one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born
					of water and the Spirit” -John 3:5.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus gives only one exception. The thief on the cross was
					“born of the Spirit,” even though it was impossible for
					him to leave the cross and be immersed in water as a sign
					of his change of heart. And Jesus promised him that he
					would be with Him in the kingdom (Luke 23:42, 43).
				</p>

				<p>
					For the thief, being “born of water and of the Spirit”
					represents the blood of Jesus which was being spilt to
					cleanse him from his sins. Augustine observed, “There
					is one case of deathbed repentance recorded, that of
					the penitent thief, that none should despair; and only
					one, that none should presume.”Jesus Himself gave this
					solemn warning:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but
					whoever does not believe [and therefore is not baptized]
					will be condemned.” -Mark 16:16
				</p>

				<p>
					By dying in our place at Calvary, Jesus made a public
					demonstration of His love for us. We need to respond
					with a public, unashamed confession of our commitment
					to Christ through baptism. Have you begun a new life in
					Christ? Have
					you been baptized? If not, why not prepare for baptism
					in the near future?
				</p>


			</div>


			<!-- section 6 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					6. BAPTISM IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
				</h2>

				<p>
					Baptism represents our commitment to a Christian
					lifestyle. But our surrender at baptism doesn’t
					automatically last a lifetime.
				</p>

				<p>
					When a child is born, a celebration is in order. After the
					day of birth is over and the excitement subsides, the baby
					requires daily feeding, daily bathing, and daily concern
					for its welfare. It’s much the same with baptism. Paul said
					of his experience, “I die every day” (1 Corinthians 15:31).
					By daily turning from selfishness, we become more and
					more responsive to Christ.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he rite of baptism, like the wedding ceremony, was
					meant to be the the formal confirmation that a wonderful
					and growing relationship has begun. In order to grow
					consistently, we need a daily giving of ourselves to Christ,
					a daily reception of a new life through prayer and Bible
					study
				</p>

			<!-- section 7 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					7. A CAUSE FOR REJOICING
				</h2>



				<p>
					Baptism is cause for great rejoicing because those who
					place their faith in Christ have the assurance of eternal
				</p>

				<p>
					life. “Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved”
					(Mark 16:16). When we are baptized, we’re on an upward
					path leading us to eternal joy.
					Baptism also celebrates a present happiness with Christ.
				</p>

				<p>
					He promises the priceless gift of the Holy Spirit to those
					baptized (Acts 2:38). With the Spirit comes “the fruit
					of the Spirit”- “love,” which fills the life with “patience,
					kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self
					control” (Galatians 5:22, 23).

				</p>

					A young woman made a decision to commit her life to
					Christ and be baptized, in spite of her husband’s threat
					of divorce. He wanted no part of her new faith, but she
					stuck to Jesus and tried to become a more loving wife
					than ever before. For some time the husband made
					things difficult at home. But finally he was won over by
					an argument he couldn’t answer: her transformed life.
					T
					his man surrendered his life to Christ and he too was
					baptized.
				</p>

				<p>
					Sticking close to Christ through “thick and thin” will
					make us powerful instruments in His hands. We can
					commit our lives to Him unconditionally because He has
					already made the ultimate commitment to us when He
					paid the price for our sins on the cross. What a privilege
					it is to publicly give Him our love and allegiance! If you
					haven’t yet done so, why not surrender your life to Christ
					right now. Ask Him to create a new life in you by the
					Holy Spirit, and then be baptized into Christ.
