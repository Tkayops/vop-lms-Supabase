					1. THE CHURCH ESTABLISHED BY JESUS
				</h2>

				<p>
					T
					he life and teachings of Jesus established unity of belief and
					close fellowship in the apostolic church that He founded. The
					apostles formed an intimate relationship with the risen Christ.
					Paul pictured that close bond as a marriage relationship:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might
					present you as a pure virgin to him.” -2 Corinthians 11:2.
					(Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER
					guides are from the New International Version of the Bible
					[NIV].)
				</p>

				<p>
					According to Paul, the Christian church is a pure woman, the
					bride of Christ, a fitting symbol of Christ’s beloved church.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">

					needs of different generations: a message to help Adam
					and Eve after sin ruined their world, a message to the
					world before the catachysm of the flood, messages for Israel
					when Assyria or Babylon threatened. Jesus came with a special
					message for His generation, and God has sounded a special
					message for our day.
					In the Old Testament the same metaphor is used to describe
					Israel, God’s chosen people. God said to Israel: “as a bride you
					loved me” (Jeremiah 2:2); “I am your husband” (Jeremiah
					3:14).
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he book of Revelation also speaks of the church as a woman:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“A great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: a woman
					clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a
					crown of twelve stars on her head.” -Revelation 12:1.
				</p>

				<div class="space-y-3 ml-6">
					<p>
						(1) The woman is “clothed with the sun.” This suggests a
						church shining like the sun, because of being clothed
						with Christ’s glorious presence. Jesus, “the light of the
						world” (John 8:12), shines through the members of
						His church, and they in turn become “the light of the
						world” (Matthew 5:14).
					</p>

					<p>
						(2) The woman has “the moon under her feet.” The
						moon represents the reflected light of the gospel in
						the sacrifices and ceremonies of God’s people in the
						Old Testament. The moon being “under her feet”
						suggests that the reflected light of the gospel has been
						superseded by Christ’s ministry.
					</p>

					<p>
						(3) The woman has “a crown of twelve stars on her head.”
						Stars fittingly represent the twelve apostles, noble men
						whose testimony about Jesus shines brilliantly to this
						very day.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					Clearly, the description of this woman indicates that John has
					in mind the transition from God’s people, Israel, in the Old
					Testament to the Christian church of the New Testament that
					Jesus established. The sun, moon, and stars emphasize the
					light-giving ministry of the Christian church in sharing the
					Good News.

					2. THE DRAMA OF SATAN’S DEFEAT
				</h2>
				<p>
					The entrance of the woman sets the stage for a great drama:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about
					to give birth. Then another sign appeared in heaven: an
					enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and
					seven crowns on his heads. His tail swept a third of the stars
					out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood
					in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that
					he might devour her child the moment it was born. She gave
					birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations with
					an iron scepter. And her child was snatched up to God and to
					his throne.” -Revelation 12:2-5
				</p>
				<p>
					Three key figures participate in this drama :
				</p>


				<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4">

							<p>
								(1) The woman, already identified as the God’s church. 1/4
							</p>
							<p>
								(2) The male child born to this woman “is snatched up
								to God and to his throne” and will someday “rule
								all nations.” Jesus is the only child ever born in this
								world who has been taken up to God’s throne and will
								someday rule all nations.
							</p>

							<p>
								(3) The dragon representing the Devil, or Satan.
							</p>
						</div>

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought
							against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought
							back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place
							in heaven. THE GREAT DRAGON was hurled down-that
							ancient serpent, CALLED THE DEVIL, OR SATAN, who
							leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and
							his angels with him.” -Revelation 12:7-9
						</p>

						<p>
							The picture becomes clear once we understand the symbols.
							When the Devil and his angels “lost their place in heaven,” they
							were “hurled to the earth.” When Jesus was born in this world,
							the Devil tried to kill Jesus, the male child, as soon as He was
							born. He failed, and Jesus was “snatched up” to God’s throne.
						</p>
						<p>
							Satan then set out to annihilate the Christian church that
							Christ established. The apostle John, who wrote Revelation,
							saw glimpses of this great conflict between Christ and Satan
							raging on this earth. As the battle reaches a climax at Christ’s
							crucifixion, John hears a voice shout from heaven:
						</p>

					</div>


				</div>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom
					of our God, and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser
					of our brothers, who accuses them before our God day and
					night, has been hurled down.” -Revelation 12:10. (Compare
					John 12:31 and Luke 10:18.)
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus won a decisive victory over Satan at the cross. Then He
					confirmed the certainty of the plan of “salvation” and provided
					“power” for resisting the cunning of Satan. “The kingdom of
					God” was madesecure, and the Savior’s “authority” to be our
					High Priest and King was confirmed.
				</p>

				<p>
					“Now have come the salvation” declares that history’s crowning
					event has arrived. The birth of Christ, the Savior of the world,
					has taken place (verse 5). In spite of Satan’s fierce temptations,
					Jesus has lived His sinless life, died and arose the victor over sin
					and death (verses 10). Satan has been forever defeated (verses
					7-9). The Cross is magnified in its full power.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he announcement, “now has come the salvation,” interests
					not only John, but the entire universe:
				</p>






				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them!
					But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone
					down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his
					time is short.” - Revelation 12:12.
				</p>

				<p>
					All heaven celebrated Jesus’ victory. Christ destroyed any claim
					Satan may have once had to a place inheaven, and a defeated
					Satan lost forever his claim to our world.

			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					3. THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH IN CONFLICT WITH
					SATAN
				</h2>

				<p>
					Before Jesus ascended to heaven He established the Christian
					church (symbolized by the woman). His death on the cross
					gave the Christian church the power to defeat Satan.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“They [the Christian church] overcame him [Satan] by the
					blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they
					did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.” -Revelation 12:11.
				</p>
				<p>
					Christ is now able to give His power, the fruit of His victory,
					to His church. Jesus decisively triumphed over Satan at the
					cross, and He now continues to triumph over Satan through
					His church. Three characteristics mark the triumphant church
					during the passing centuries of the Christian era:
				</p>
				<div class="space-y-3 ml-6">
					<p>
						(1) “They overcame him [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb.”
						Jesus was caught up to God’s throne so He could make
						His blood effective in the lives of his followers. He can
						clear the record of our sins, save us through His shed
						blood (1 John 1:7), and give us power to live a healthy
						Christian life day by day.
					</p>
					<p>
						(2) “They did not love their lives so much as to shrink from
						death.” “The blood of the Lamb” made them willing to
						die for Christ’s cause; they did not “shrink from death.”
						God had suffered greatly, so these Christian martyrs
						were also willing to suffer and die. Even children made
						the ultimate sacrifice. A story is told of a Christian
						mother who was thrown to the lions in a Roman arena
						because she gave her ultimate allegiance to Christ
						and not to the state. Her young daughter, instead
						of shrinking back in horror, felt a fervent devotion
						welling up inside. As the lions attacked her mother, she
						stood and cried, “I too am a Christian.” Roman officials
						arrested her and hurled her to the hungry beasts.
					</p>
					<p>
						(3) “They overcame him [Satan] . . . by the word of their
						testimony.” Not the words, but the word of their
						testimony-the testimony of their lives, their living
						witness to the power of Jesus and His gospel. During
						the darkest hours of the Christian era an army of
						Christians-from the early church fathers to the
						Protestant reformers-overcame the worst the Devil
						could hurl at them, simply by the dynamic witness of
						their lives.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					Revelation 12:11 pictures a victorious church filled with
					overcomers: apostles, martyrs, reformers, and other faithful Christians. Their kindness,
					faithfulness, courage, and triumph
					has thundered down the centuries and moved the world.
				</p>

				<p>
					Since Satan failed to destroy Jesus when He lived on earth, he
					now seeks to destroy the Christ who lives in His church
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth,
					he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
					T
					he woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that
					she might fly to the place prepared for her in the desert, where
					she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time,
					out of the serpent’s reach. Then from his mouth the serpent
					spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep
					her away with the torrent. But the earth helped the woman by
					opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon
					had spewed out of his mouth.” -Revelation 12:13-16.
				</p>

				<p>
					Just as predicted, during the Dark Ages of the Christian era,
					Satan sent “a river” of persecution “to sweep” the church “away
					with the torrent.” Satan wants to destroy Christ’s influence by
					wiping out His church and uses every trick his evil genius can
					devise. The dragon represents Satan primarily. But remember
					that Satan uses human institutions in his role as dragon to
					attack God’s people. He used the Roman king Herod in an
					attempt to murder the Christ child as soon as He was born.
					He worked through Christ’s jealous religious rivals to stalk
					and harass the Savior, and finally secure His execution on the
					cross. But Satan’s apparent victory turned into Christ’s greatest
					triumph
				</p>
				<p>
					Furious over his defeat at the Cross, Satan turned his wrath
					against the church that Jesus established. During the decades
					after Christ’s crucifixion, thousands met their death in the
					Roman Colosseum, city squares, dungeons, and desert
					hideaways. At first secular authorities initiated this persecution.
					But after the death of the apostles a gradual change crept into
					the church. During the second, third, and fourth centuries,
					many in the church began to modify the truths Christ and
					His apostles had taught. Some apostate leaders even began to
					persecute those Christians who insisted on the purity of New
					Testament beliefs.
				</p>

				<p>
					Scholars estimate that about 50 million of the faithful perished.
					In an effort to drown out the church and destroy it, the Devil
					sent “a river” of persecution “to sweep her [the church] away
					with the torrent.” “But the earth helped the woman by . . .
					swallowing the river” of persecution and false doctrine
				</p>

				<p>
					During these medieval persecutions, the true church withdrew
					from the apostate leadership and took refuge in “the desert to
					a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken
					care of for 1,260 days” (verse 6). This prediction was fulfilled
					during the 1260 years of persecution from A.D. 538 to 1798
					(a day often stands for a year in symbolic Bible prophecy, see
					Ezekiel 4:6).
				</p>
				<p>
					During these dark centuries, faithful Bible-believing
					Christians found refuge wherever they could; for example, in
					the Waldensian valleys of western Italy and eastern France, and
					in the Celtic church of the British Isles.
				</p>

				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					4. GOD’S CHURCH IN OUR DAY
				</h2>

				<p>
					This brings us to our day-to the true church of Christ since
					1798. As might be expected, the Dragon is still angry with
					God’s people. The great unseen war continues. In fact, Satan
					makes his greatest attack on the church just before Jesus comes.
				</p>
				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Then the dragon [the devil] was enraged at the woman [God’s church] and went off to make war
					against the rest of
					her offspring-those who obey God’s commandments and hold
					to the testimony of Jesus.” - Revelation 12:17.
				</p>

				<p>
					This prophecy focuses on our day. Satan is enraged; he wages
					war on “the rest of ” the woman’s “offspring”-God’s present-day
					people. Notice their identifying marks:
				</p>


				<div class="space-y-3 ml-6">

					<p>
						(1) These last-day believers “hold to the testimony of Jesus.”
						Clinging faithfully to the pure doctrines of the
						Word of God, they testify for Jesus through dynamic Christian
						living.
					</p>
					<p>
						(2) These last-day Christians are a people of prophecy.
						Receiving “the testimony of Jesus Christ” enabled John
						to write the book of Revelation (Revelation 1:1-3). The
						final group of believers receive a similar gift: direct
						testimonies from God through an earthly messenger.
						Their gift of prophecy focuses on God’s revelation of
						their mission and their final destiny.
					</p>

					<p>
						(3) These last-day Christians are also identified as “those
						who obey God’s commandments.” They not only
						defend the integrity of the Ten Commandments, they
						also obey them. God’s love in their hearts produces
						joyful obedience (Romans 5:5; 13:8-10). These last-day
						Christians follow the example of Christ and the early
						church in obeying the commandments of God. This
						greatly provokes the Dragon-the Devil. And he wages
						war with “the rest of ” the woman’s “offspring” because
						they bear witness that love for God produces obedient
						disciples. As Jesus charged:
					</p>
				</div>



				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“If you love me, you will obey what I command.” -John 14:15.
				</p>

				<p>
					The lives of these last-day Christians show that it’s possible to
					love God with all our hearts and our fellow human beings as
					ourselves. According to Jesus, these qualities, love for God and
					love for people, sum up God’s Ten Commandments (Matthew
					22:35-40).
				</p>
				<p>
					The fourth of those commandments asks us to observe
					Saturday, the seventh day of the week, as the Sabbath. Since
					a love for Jesus has imbedded all ten of the commandments
					in their hearts, these last-day Christians are Sabbath-keepers.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Sabbath is at the heart of God’s final message to His people
					in Revelation, chapters 12, and 14:6-15. All the resources of
					heaven are arrayed behind the last-day Christians described
					in these chapters. A living Savior is their constant companion,
					and the Holy Spirit works to “strengthen them with power in
					the inner man.” The promise is sure. They will overcome Satan
					“by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony”
					(Revelation 12:11).
				</p>

				<p>
					Do you wish to be one of these last-day Christians who “obey
					God’s commandments” and “hold to the testimony of Jesus”?
					Why not make that decision just now?
				</p>
