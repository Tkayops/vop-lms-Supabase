					1. FACING DEATH UNAFRAID
				</h2>

				<p>
					All of us at certain moments, perhaps right after the
					passing of a friend or loved one, have felt that emptiness
					in the pit of our stomachs, that lonely feeling that sweeps
					over us, as we catch a glimpse of the end of life.
				</p>

				<p>
					In a matter so important, so packed with emotion, where
					can we learn the truth about what happens when we die?
					Fortunately, part of Christ’s mission on earth was to “free
					those who all their lives were held in slavery by their
					fear of death” (Hebrews 2:15). And in the Bible, Jesus
					presents comforting messages, and answers clearly all
					our questions about death and a future life.
				</p>

			<!-- section 2 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					2. HOW GOD MADE US
				</h2>
				<p>
					To understand from the Bible the real truth about death,
					let’s start at the beginning and see how our Creator made
					us.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“The LORD God formed the man [adam, Hebrew] from
					the DUST OF THE GROUND [adamah, Hebrew] and
					breathed into his nostrils THE BREATH OF LIFE, and
					the man became A LIVING BEING [SOUL, Hebrew].” -Genesis 2:7. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural
					texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New
					International Version of the Bible [NIV].)
				</p>
				<p>
					At Creation God fashioned Adam from “the dust of the
					ground.” He had a brain in his head ready to think; blood
					in his veins ready to flow. Then God breathed into his
					nostrils “the breath of life,” and Adam became “a living
					being” [Hebrew, “a living soul”]. Note carefully, the Bible
					does not say Adam received a soul; rather it says that
					“man became a living soul.” As God breathed into Adam,
					life began to flow from God. The combination of the
					body and “the breath of life” made Adam “a living being,”
					“a living soul.” So we might write the human equation
					like this:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Dust of Ground” + “Breath of Life” = “A Living Soul”
					Lifeless Body + Breath from God = A Living Being
				</p>

				<p>
					Each of us has a body and a reasoning mind. As long as
					we continue to breathe, we will be a living being, a living
					soul.
				</p>




			</div>


			<!-- section 3 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					3. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PERSON DIES?
				</h2>

				<p>
					At death the reverse of the creative process described in
					Genesis 2:7 takes place:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“And the DUST returns to the ground it came from, and
					the SPIRIT [BREATH OF LIFE] returns to God who
					gave it.” -Ecclesiastes 12:7.
				</p>
				<p>
					T
					he Bible often uses the Hebrew words for “breath” and
					“spirit” interchangeably. When people die, their body
					becomes “dust” and the “spirit” (the “breath of life”)
					returns to God, its source. But what happens to the soul?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, . .
					. every LIVING SOUL belongs to me. . . . THE SOUL
					WHO SINS IS THE ONE WHO WILL DIE.” -Ezekiel
					18:3-4.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he soul dies! It is not now immortal-it can perish. The
					equation derived from Genesis 2:7, when God made us,
					reverses itself at death.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Dust of Earth” Ã “Breath of Life” = “A Dead Soul”
					Lifeless Body Ã Breath from God = A Dead Being
				</p>

				<p>
					Death is the cessation of life. The body disintegrates to
					dust, and the breath, or spirit, goes back to God. We are a
					living soul in life, but in death only a corpse, a dead soul,
					dead being. So the dead are not conscious. When God
					takes back the breath of life He gave to us, our soul dies.
					But as we will see later in this lesson, with Christ there is
					hope.
				</p>




			</div>


			<!-- section 4 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					4. HOW MUCH DOES A DEAD PERSON KNOW?
				</h2>

				<p>
					After death the brain disintegrates; it can’t know or
					remember anything. All human emotions cease at death.
					“Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long
					since vanished . . .” -Ecclesiastes 9:6. The dead are not
					conscious, so they are not aware of anything that takes
					place. They have absolutely no contact with the living:
				</p>
				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“For the living know that they will die, but THE DEAD
					KNOW NOTHING.” -Ecclesiastes 9:5.
				</p>

				<p>
					Death is like a dreamless sleep-in fact, the Bible calls
					death a “sleep” 54 times. Jesus taught that death is like a
					sleep. He said to His disciples:
				</p>
				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“’Our friend LAZARUS HAS FALLEN ASLEEP; but I
					am going there to wake him up.’ His disciples replied,
					‘Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.’ Jesus had been
					speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant
					natural sleep. So then he told them plainly, ‘LAZARUS
					IS DEAD.’” -John 11:11-14.
				</p>

				<p>
					Lazarus was dead for four days before Jesus arrived. But
					when Jesus went to his tomb, He proved that it is as easy
					for God to raise the dead as for us to awaken a sleeping
					companion.
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s a great comfort to know that our deceased loved ones
					are “asleep,” resting peacefully in Jesus. The tunnel of
					death, which we ourselves may someday pass through, is
					like quiet, peaceful sleep
				</p>




			</div>


			<!-- section 5 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					5. DOES GOD FORGET THOSE WHO SLEEP IN
					DEATH?
				</h2>

				<p>
					T
					he sleep of death is not the end of the story. At the tomb,
					Jesus said to Martha, Lazarus’ sister:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“I AM THE RESURRECTION and the life. HE WHO
					BELIEVES IN ME WILL LIVE, even though he dies.” -
					John 11:25.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					hose who die “in Christ” sleep in the grave-but they
					still have a bright future. The One who counts every
					hair on our heads and holds us in the palm of His hand
					will not forget us. We may die and return to the dust,
					but the record of our individuality remains clear in the
					mind of God. And when Jesus comes, He will awaken the
					righteous dead from their sleep, just like He did Lazarus.
				</p>

						</p>



					</div>


				</div>

				<p>
					The hope of resurrection has a companion: the hope of
					a heavenly home where God “will wipe away every tear
					from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning
					or crying or pain”(Revelation 21:4). Those who love God
					don’t have to fear death. Beyond it lies an eternity of a
					fulfilling life with God. Jesus holds “the keys of death”
					(Revelation 1:18). Without Christ, death would be a one
					way street ending in oblivion, but with Christ there is a
					bright, radiant hope.
				</p>

			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					6. ARE WE IMMORTAL NOW?
				</h2>

				<p>
					When God created Adam and Eve, they were created
					mortal, that is, subject to death. Had they remained
					obedient to God’s will they would never have died. But
					when they sinned, they gave up their right to life. By
					disobedience they became subject to death. Their sin
					infected the entire human race, and since all have sinned,
					we are all mortal, subject to death (Romans 5:12). And
					there is not even a hint in the Bible that the human soul
					can exist as a conscious entity after death.
				</p>
				<p>
					T
					he Bible never once describes the soul as now being
					immortal-that is, not subject to death. The Hebrew and
					Greek words for “soul,” “spirit,” and “breath” occur in the
					Bible 1,700 times. But not once is the human soul, spirit,
					or breath referred to as immortal. At the present time
					God alone possesses immortality.
				</p>


				<p>
					“God . . . ALONE IS IMMORTAL.” -1 Timothy 6:15, 16.
				</p>

				<p>
					Scripture makes it clear that people in this life are mortal:
					subject to death. But when Jesus returns, our nature will
					undergo a radical change.
				</p>



				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Listen, I tell you a mystery: WE WILL NOT ALL
					SLEEP, but WE WILL ALL BE CHANGED-in a flash, in
					the twinkling of an eye, AT THE LAST TRUMPET. For
					the trumpet will sound, THE DEAD WILL BE RAISED
					imperishable, AND WE WILL BE CHANGED. For the
					perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and
					THE MORTAL WITH IMMORTALITY.” -1 Corinthians
					15:51-53.
				</p>

				<p>
					As human beings, we are not now immortal. But the
					Christian’s assurance is that we become immortal when
					Jesus comes again a second time. The certainty of the
					promise of immortality was demonstrated when Jesus
					burst open His tomb and:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“DESTROYED DEATH and . . . BROUGHT LIFE AND
					IMMORTALITY TO LIGHT through the gospel.” -2
					Timothy 1:10.
				</p>

				<p>
					God’s perspective on human destiny is clear: eternal
					death for those who reject Christ and cling to theirsins,
					or immortality as a gift when Jesus comes for those who
					have accepted Him as Lord and Savior.

					7. FACING THE DEATH OF A LOVED ONE

					he fears that we naturally struggle with in the face of
					death become especially acute when a loved one dies.
					T
					he loneliness and sense of loss can be overwhelming.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he only solution to the anguish caused by separation
					from a loved one is the comfort that only Christ gives.
					Remember that your loved one is asleep, and your loved
					ones who rest in Jesus will rise in the “resurrection of life”
					when Jesus comes.
				</p>

				<p>
					God is planning some wonderful reunions. Children will
					be returned to their ecstatic parents. Husbands and wives
					will melt into each other’s arms. Life’s cruel separations
					will be over. “Death has been swallowed up in victory” (1
					Corinthians 15:54).
				</p>

				<p>
					Some feel the separation from a loved one so keenly
					that they try to make contact with their dead loved ones
					through a spiritualist medium or a New Age channeler.
					But the Bible specifically warns us against trying to ease
					the pain of death in this way:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“When men tell you to consult mediums and spiritists,
					who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire
					of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the
					living?” -Isaiah 8:19
				</p>

				<p>
					Indeed, Why? The Bible clearly reveals that the dead are
					not conscious. The real solution to the anguish caused
					by separation from a loved one is the comfort that only
					Christ gives. Spending time communicating with Christ
					is the healthiest way to grow through the grieving process.
					Remember always, the next conscious impression that
					comes to those who sleep in Christ will be the sounds of
					the second coming of Christ to awaken the dead!

					8. FACING DEATH UNAFRAID
				</h2>

				<p>
					Death robs us of almost everything. But the one thing it
					can’t take from us is Christ, and Christ can put everything
					back together again. Death will not always reign in this
					world. The Devil, the wicked, death, and the grave will
					perish in “the lake of fire” which is “the second death”
					(Revelation 20:14).
				</p>

				<p>
					Here are four simple suggestions for facing death
					unafraid:
				</p>
				<div class="space-y-3 ml-6">
					<p>
						(1) Live a life of hopeful trust in Christ, and you will
						be prepared for death at any moment.
					</p>

					<p>
						(2) Through the power of the Holy Spirit, be obedient
						to Christ’s commandments, and you will be
						prepared for a second life in which you will never
						die.
					</p>
					<p>
						(3) Think of death as a short sleep from which Jesus’
						voice will awaken you when He comes a second
						time.
					</p>

					<p>
						(4) Cherish the assurance Jesus gives us of a heavenly
						home with Him for all eternity.
					</p>

				<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
					<div class="col-span-3 space-y-2 text-justify  md:px-0">
						<p>
							Bible truth releases a person from the fear of death
							because it reveals Jesus, the One whom even death could
							not conquer. When Jesus comes into our lives, He floods
							our hearts with peace:
						</p>

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. . . . Do not
							let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.” -John
							14:27.
						</p>

						<p>
							Jesus also makes it possible for us to cope with the tragedy
							of losing a loved one. Jesus walked through “the valley of
							the shadow of death”; He knows about the dark nights we
							go through.
						</p>

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in
							their humanity so that BY HIS DEATH he might destroy
							him who holds the power of death-that is, the devil-and FREE THOSE WHO ALL THEIR LIVES WERE
							HELD IN
							SLAVERY BY THEIR FEAR OF DEATH.” -Hebrews 2:14,
							15.
						</p>

						<p>
							Dr. James Simpson, the great physician who developed
							anesthesia, experienced a terrible loss when his eldest
							child died. He grieved deeply as any parent would. But
							then he
							found his way to hope. On his beloved child’s grave he
							erected a marker and on it he carved these words Jesus
							spoke concerning His resurrection: “Nevertheless, I live.”
						</p>

						<p>

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					In Christ we have hope of life after death. He is “the
					resurrection and the life” (John 11:25), and He promises,
					“Because I live, you also will live” (John 14:19). Christ is
					our only hope of life after death. And when Christ comes
					again He gives us immortality. We will never again live
					under the shadow of death, for we have eternal life. Have
					you discovered this great hope that we can cherish in our
					darkest moments? If you have never accepted Jesus as
					your Lord and Savior, will you do it just now?
