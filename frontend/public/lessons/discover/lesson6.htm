					1. WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE LOST TO BE SAVED
				</h2>

				<p>
					It’s possible for a physically alive person to be having what some
					call a good time, and still be dead-that is, spiritually dead.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“YOU WERE DEAD IN YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS AND
					SINS, in which you used to live when you followed the ways
					of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, THE
					[EVIL] SPIRIT WHO IS NOW AT WORK in those who are
					disobedient.” -Ephesians 2:1, 2.
				</p>

				<p>
					Satan leads a spiritually dead person down a descending spiral
					of sin and disobedience. But the wonderful truth of the gospel is
					that God loves such doomed people. He loves them while they
					are dead in their sins, and offers them a full and free deliverance
					from their predicament.
				</p>



				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy,
					MADE US ALIVE WITH CHRIST EVEN WHEN WE WERE
					DEAD IN TRANSGRESSIONS . . . [to] show the incomparable
					riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ
					Jesus.” -Ephesians 2:4-7.
				</p>

				<p>
					God loved us when we had nothing lovable about us. His grace
					created in us a new life in Christ. We can’t change ourselves, but God can. When we come to Him in
					faith
					and submission, He gives us a second chance at life as a free gift

										We can’t save ourselves from sin or change our nature

					4. WE ARE SAVED BY TAKING THREE SIMPLE STEPS
				</h2>

				<!-- steps -->
				<div class="space-y-3">
					<h5 class="text-sm font-semibold">
						Step 1. Ask Christ to deal with the sin in your life.
					</h5>

					<p>
						What is our part in getting rid of our sinful life?
					</p>

					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“REPENT, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be
						wiped out.” -Acts 3:19.
					</p>

					<p>
						What leads a person to repent?
					</p>

					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“GOD’S KINDNESS LEADS YOU TOWARD REPENTANCE.” -Romans 2:4.
					</p>

					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“YOUR SORROW LED YOU TO REPENTANCE.” - 2 Corinthians 7:9.
					</p>

					<p>
						Repentance is simply being sorry for our past life of sin, and
						then turning away from our sins, making a break with the old
						habits, practices, and attitudes. It’s not sorrow just because we
						fear punishment, but a response to “God’s kindness” that led
						Jesus to die in our place for our sinfulness. We reject sin because
						it hurts God.
					</p>

					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						When we experience a new life in Christ, we should so far as
						possible make past wrongs right (Ezekiel 33:14-16).
					</p>

					<p>
						What is God’s part in getting rid of our old life of sin?
					</p>
					<p>
						Both repentance and being forgiven are a gift to us from God.
					</p>

					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and SAVIOR
						that he might GIVE REPENTANCE and FORGIVENESS OF
						SINS.” -Acts 5:31.
					</p>

					<div class="bg-black text-white pt-2">
						<h5 class=" text-center uppercase"> HOW WE RECEIVE A
							NEW LIFE FROM CHRIST</h5>
						<ol class=" list-decimal space-y-2 pl-6 py-2">
							<li>We beleive in Him and receive Him as
								Saviour and Lord.</li>
							<li>We establish a relationship with Him. (A
								regular time of prayer and Bible reading is
								vital.)</li>
							<li>Christ works through His Spirit to replace
								our bad habits with His good qualities.</li>

						</ol>
					</div>

					<p>
						And when we repent, a loving Savior forgives our sins, cleanses
						us from sin, and throws them into the depths of the sea.
					</p>

					<p class="text-sm font-semibold italic">
						“IF WE CONFESS our sins, HE IS FAITHFUL and just AND
						WILL FORGIVE US our sins and PURIFY US FROM all
						unrighteousness.” -1 John 1:9. (See also Micah 7:18, 19.)
					</p>

					<p>
						There is no sin so terrible that the Savior who died for our sins
						on Calvary’s cross can’t forgive. A person who trusts in Jesus
						need only ask Him for His pardon. Christ’s dying for us can’t
						pardon us unless we ask to be forgiven. It’s a sobering fact that
						our sins helped drive those nails through Christ’s hands and
						feet. And yet Jesus is more eager than we can imagine for us to
						accept His gift of pardon and reconciliation.
					</p>

					<p>
						Word reached a young man who’d run away from home that his
						mother was dying. The news filled him with remorse over their
						broken relationship. Hurrying home, he rushed into the room
						and threw himself on his mother’s bed. In a flood of tears he
						begged her to forgive him.
					</p>

					<p>
						She drew him close and whispered, “Son, I would have forgiven
						you long ago if you’d only asked.” If you have drifted away from
						God-or have not yet come to know Him-please think about how
						eager your loving heavenly Father is to welcome you home. He
						wants more than anything else for you to accept His offer of
						pardon. Jesus loves you. He died for you. He is always willing
						to forgive you. So respond to His gracious invitation to repent.
						Confess your sins. Simply believe that God forgives you, and he
						does. Trust Him! Trust His promises.
					</p>

				</div>

				<!-- step 2 -->
				<div class="space-y-3">
					<h5 class="text-sm font-semibold">
						Step 2. Receive a new life from Jesus.
					</h5>

					<p>
						Your part in receiving a new life from Jesus is to believe that
						Jesus has really saved you. Accept without question the fact that
						He has forgiven and cleansed you, taken away your old life of
						sin, and given you an entirely new and changed life.
					</p>

					<p class="italiic text-sm font-semibold">
						“All . . . who believed in his name, he gave the right [power,
						authority, privilege] to become children of God.” -John 1:12.
					</p>

					<p>
						As a child of God, you have “the right” to receive a new life from
						Jesus. As we have said, you can’t achieve it on your own-it’s a gift
						from your heavenly Father! Jesus gives such an absolute promise
						in order to remove our insecurities and doubts.
					</p>

					<p>
						What is God’s part in giving us a new life?
					</p>

					<p class="italiic text-sm font-semibold">
						“Jesus declared, ‘I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom
						of God unless he is born again’.” -John 3:3.
					</p>

					<p>
						According to Jesus, a believing, repentant sinner is actually born
						into a new life. It is a miracle that only God can perform. He
						promises:
					</p>

					<p class="italiic text-sm font-semibold">
						“I will give you a NEW HEART and put a NEW SPIRIT in you;
						I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart
						of flesh.” -Ezekiel 36:26.
					</p>

					<p>
						Jesus transforms our heart-our feelings and behavior-and dwells
						“in us” (Colossians 1:27). This new life is not just a nice, spiritual
						idea; it’s a hard, solid fact, a resurrection from spiritual death to
						an entirely new life and existence.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- step 3 -->
				<div class="space-y-3">
					<h5 class="text-sm font-semibold">
						Step 3. Live for Jesus every day.
					</h5>

					<p>
						The Christian life involves a daily turning away from selfishness,
						and bonding with Jesus as our loving Friend. We grow in this
						new life by strengthening our relationship with Jesus. This
						means spending quality time with Him, building honest and
						open communication. God has given us five divine aids for
						spiritual growth: Bible study, prayer, meditation, fellowship with
						other Christians, and sharing our experience with others.
					</p>
					<p>
						Living in Christ doesn’t mean we never make mistakes. But
						when we stumble and sin, we claim Christ’s forgiveness, and
						keep going. We’re headed in a certain direction, and we know
						Christ remains a living presence in our hearts.

					5. THE JOY OF THE SECOND CHANCE
				</h2>

				<p>
					Harold Hughes received many honors during his distinguished
					career as a U.S. Senator, but the one that meant the most to him
					came shortly after his commitment to Christ.
				</p>
				<p>
					Harold was studying the Bible alone in his living room one
					evening when he felt a nudge at his elbow. He looked up. It was
					his two small daughters, standing quietly in their nightgowns.
					He stared at them for a moment; they had changed so much,
					and he had missed so much during his devastating battle with
					the bottle.
				</p>
				<p>
					T
					hen Carol, the younger said, “Daddy, we’ve come to kiss you
					good-night.” The father’s eyes blurred. It had been so long since
					the children had come for his embrace. Now their beautiful
					clear eyes held no fear. Daddy had come home at last. Jesus does
					truly give people a second chance. He takes the most hopeless
					cases and creates new beginnings.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Savior longs for each one of us to come home at last. Have
					you accepted Christ’s loving invitation?
				</p>
				<p>
					Receiving God’s forgiveness and cleansing is as simple and
					profound as opening your arms for a child’s embrace.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have not yet trusted in Christ as your personal Savior, you
					can do so right now by praying something like this:
				</p>
				<p>
					“Father, I am sorry for my old life of sin. Thank you for sending
					your Son to this world to die in my place. Jesus, please forgive my
					sins and come into my life and save me. I want a second chance
					at life-I want to be born again. Even more, I want to establish
					a day-by-day relationship with You. Thank you for performing
					this miracle in me. In Jesus name, Amen.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Make this wonderful discovery: When we do the coming, Jesus
					does the saving.
