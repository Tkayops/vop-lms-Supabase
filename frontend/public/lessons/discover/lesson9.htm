					When Marco Polo returned to his hometown of
					Venice after many years in the Orient, his friends
					thought his long journeys had driven him mad.
					He had such incredible tales to tell.
				</p>

				<p>
					Marco had travelled to a city full of silver and gold. He’d
					seen black stones that burned, but no one had ever heard
					of coal. He’d seen a cloth that refused to catch fire even
					when thrown into the flames, but no one had ever heard
					of asbestos. He talked of huge serpents ten paces long
					with jaws wide enough to swallow a man, nuts the size
					of a man’s head and white as milk inside, and a substance
					spurting from the ground that actually set lamps alight.
					But no one had ever seen crocodiles, coconuts, or crude
					oil. They just laughed at such stories. Years later, when
					Marco lay dying, a devout man at his bedside urged him
					to recant all the tall tales he’d told. But Marco refused:
					“It’s all true-every bit of it. In fact, I have not told half of
					what I saw.”

				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he Bible writers who give us glimpses of heaven seem
					to echo Marco Polo’s sentiment. In vision they looked on
					a place so brilliant, so fantastic, that they could describe
					only a fraction of what they saw. And we face a challenge
					similar to that of Marco Polo’s friends. We must try to
					imagine the “crocodiles and coconuts” that we’ve never
					seen, because the glimpses we do get in the Bible show
					us that heaven is much more than sitting on clouds and
					playing on harps.

					1. IS HEAVEN A REAL PLACE?
				</h2>

				<p>
					Jesus is preparing a very real place for us right now in a
					very real heaven.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God,
					believe also in me [Jesus]. In my Father’s house are
					many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.
					I GO TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR YOU. And if I go and
					prepare a place for you, I WILL COME AGAIN, and
					receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may
					be also.” -John 14:1-3, KJV. (Unless otherwise noted, all
					Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the
					New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)
				</p>

				<p>
					Jesus is coming to our world a second time to take us to a
					custom-made mansion in a heavenly city that is glorious
					beyond our wildest dreams: the New Jerusalem.
				</p>

				<p>
					After we’ve lived there for a thousand years, Christ
					intends to bring this heavenly home down to planet Earth. As the New Jerusalem descends, fire will
					purify
					the entire world. Our renewed planet then becomes the
					permanent home of the saved. (Revelation 20:7-15. More
					about this in Guide 22.)
				</p>

				<p>
					What does John, who wrote Revelation, picture next?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the
					f
					irst heaven and the first earth had passed away, and
					there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the
					new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
					prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
					And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, ‘Now
					the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with
					them. They will be his people, and God himself will be
					with them and be their God.’” -Revelation 21:1-3.
				</p>

				<p>
					After its transformation by fire, who does Jesus promise
					will occupy the new earth?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Blessed are the meek: for they will inherit the earth.” -Matthew 5:5. (See also Revelation 21:7.)
				</p>

				<p>
					Christ promises to restore His once perfect world to its
					original Edenic beauty, and the meek “will inherit the
					earth.”
				</p>

				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					2. WILL WE HAVE REAL BODIES IN HEAVEN?
				</h2>

				<p>
					When Jesus appeared to His disciples in His resurrected
					and glorified body, how did He describe it?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me
					and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you
					see I have.” -Luke 24:39.
				</p>

				<p>
					Jesus had a real body; He invited Thomas to touch Him
					(John 20:27). On this occasion Jesus walked into a real
					house, talked to real people, and ate real food (Luke 24:43).
					Heaven isn’t inhabited by ghosts, but by real people who
					enjoy a spiritual life, and who have a “glorious body.”
				</p>

				<p class="text-sm font-semibold italic">
					“But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await
					a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the
					power that enables him to bring everything under his
					control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will
					be like his glorious body.” -Philippians 3:20, 21.
				</p>

				<p>
					We can be assured that our heavenly bodies will be as
					solid and real as Christ’s resurrected body. Will we
					recognize our family and friends in heaven?
				</p>

				<p class="text-sm font-semibold italic">
					“Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then
					we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall
					know fully, even as I am fully known.” -1 Corinthians
					13:12.
				</p>

				<p>
					In heaven we “shall know fully.” We’ll understand and
					appreciate one another more deeply than we ever have
					in this present world. Jesus’ disciples recognized Him in
					His heavenly body, apparently because of His familiar
					features (Luke 24:36-43). Mary knew Him at the tomb
					because of the familiar sound of His voice when He
					called her by name (John 20:14-16). The two disciples
					at Emmaus identified Him because of certain familiar
					gestures.
				</p>

				<p class="text-sm font-semibold italic">
					When they noticed the way their guest blessed the food,
					they recognized Him as the Lord by His manner (Luke
					24:13-35).
				</p>

				<p>
					The redeemed are certain to experience thrilling “face-to
					face” reunions in heaven. Imagine the joy of recognizing
					your spouse’s special smile, or the familiar call of a child
					you laid to rest long ago, or the endearing gestures of
					some beloved friend. We’ll have an eternity to deepen life’s
					most precious bonds and to develop intimate friendships
					with the most fascinating personalities in the universe.

					3. WHAT WILL WE DO IN HEAVEN?
				</h2>

				<p>
					We’ll have plenty of activities to challenge us in heaven.
					How about designing your own dream house?
				</p>

				<p class="font-semibold italic text-sm">
					“Behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth...I
					will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my
					people...They will build houses and dwell in them; they
					will plant vineyards and eat their fruit...My chosen ones
					will long enjoy the works of their hands.” -Isaiah 65:17
					22.

							Jesus is already preparing personalized homes for us

							landscaping them with heaven’s rich variety of plant life.
							And who knows what high-tech adventures await us
							in God’s advanced civilization? Our present scientific
							breakthroughs and space odysseys will seem like child’s

						</p>

						<p>
							God will transform the earth into a pristine Garden of
							Eden. No more oil spills or smog or drought; the lakes stay
							crystal clear, the trees majestic, and the mountainsides
							unscarred. Not only the beauties of the world, but also
							our capacity to absorb them will be greatly intensified.
							It will seem like that first day outdoors after a very long
							illness. And the first “twenty minutes of reality” will
							extend into a magical eternity. Do you enjoy experiencing
							new things? Learning? Creating?

					“There, immortal minds will contemplate with never
					failing delight the wonders of creative power, the
					mysteries of redeeming love....Every faculty will be
					developed, every capacity increased. The acquirement
					of knowledge will not weary the mind or exhaust the
					energies. There the grandest enterprises may be carried
					forward, the loftiest aspirations reached, the highest
					ambitions realized; and still there will arise new heights
					to surmount, new wonders to admire, new truths to
					comprehend, fresh objects to call forth the powers of
					mind and soul and body. All the treasures of the universe
					will be open to the study of God’s redeemed.”-Ellen G.
					White, The Great Controversy (Nampa, Idaho; Pacific
					Press Publishing Association, 1950), page 677.

					4. WILL EVIL EVER THREATEN HEAVEN
					AGAIN?
				</h2>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone
					who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those
					whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.” -Revelation 21:27.
				</p>

				<p>
					God is going to completely eliminate sin and its terrible
					results; they will never appear again. When Jesus appears,
					“we shall be like Him” (1John 3:2). Instead of resisting
					impulses to kill, steal, lie, or rape, we’ll pursue heavenly
					graces.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“[God] will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will
					be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the
					old order of things has passed away.” -Revelation 21:4.
				</p>

				<p>
					Even the ultimate enemy, death, will vanish. In heaven’s
					land of eternal youth the redeemed are “immortal” (1 Corinthians 15:53); no inhabitant will ever
					suffer the
					ravages of old age. Heaven not only destroys the results
					of sin, it also reverses them. Imagine what it will be like
					for those who’ve struggled with lifelong handicaps:
				</p>

				<p class="text-sm font-semibold italic">
					“Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of
					the deaf unstopped. Then will the lame leap like a deer,
					and the mute tongue shout for joy.” -Isaiah 35:5, 6

					5. WHAT IS HEAVEN’S GREATEST THRILL?
				</h2>

				<p>
					Imagine seeing the Lord of the universe face-to-face.

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live
					with them. They will be his people, and God himself will

				</p>

				<p>
					God Almighty promises to be our companion and tutor.
					What a joy to sit at His feet! Think what a musician might
					give to be able to spend a few moments with Beethoven
					or Mozart. Imagine how much a physicist would treasure
					the chance to sit down with Albert Einstein, or how much
					it would mean for a painter to talk with Michelangelo
					or Rembrandt. Just think, the redeemed will have an
					infinitely greater privilege. They will converse with the
					Author of all music, science, and art. They will be on
					intimate terms with the greatest Mind and deepest Heart
					in the universe. And this relationship will overflow into
					worship.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“’From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath
					to another, all mankind will come and bow down before
					me,’ says the LORD.” -Isaiah 66:23.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the center of the heavenly city stands the great white
					throne of God. Encircled by an emerald rainbow, His
					face shines like a blazing sun. Below His feet a glassy
					sea extends in all directions. On this crystal surface
					reflecting God’s glory, the redeemed gather to pour out
					their exultant praise.
				</p>

					“And the ransomed of the LORD will return. They will

				<p>
					Here is Someone whose goodness never misses a beat.
					His faithfulness and patience and compassion just keep
					rolling on. Praise His holy name!

					6. WE MUST BE THERE!
				</h2>

				<p>
					Jesus longs for that face-to-face meeting. That’s why He
					was willing to rescue you from sin at such great cost. You
					must personally take advantage of this gift. You must
					make a commitment to Christ as Lord and Savior. You
					need the pardon that is offered from the cross, because:

					“Nothing impure will ever enter [the New Jerusalem],
					nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful,
					but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s
					book of life.” -Revelation 21:27.
				</p>

				<p>
					Jesus delivers us from sin, not in sin. We must come to Him through His power in us and be separated
					from the
					impure and the unholy. Jesus is our password into His
					soon-coming kingdom. And that kingdom can have its
					beginning right now in your heart. When Christ delivers
					us from sin, He creates a little heaven within. He can
					help us deal with the worry, anger, lust, fear, and guilt
					that plague us. The hope of heaven isn’t an escape from
					life’s problems; it helps create more heaven on earth. A
					recently conducted poll showed that “those who believe
					in life after death lead happier lives and trust people more
					than those who don’t.” Nothing will have a more dramatic
					impact on your life right now than a trusting relationship
					with Jesus Christ. Listen to how Peter describes the
					impact of a living faith:
				</p>

				<p class="text-sm font-semibold italic">
					“Though you have not seen him, you love him; and
					even though you do not see him now, you believe in him
					and are FILLED WITH AN INEXPRESSIBLE AND
					GLORIOUS JOY, for you are receiving the goal of your
					faith, the salvation of your souls.” -1 Peter 1:8, 9.

				<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4 gap-6">

							All of this-and heaven too. Have you discovered the kind

							don’t turn away from His gracious invitation.

						<p class="italic text-sm font-semibold">
							“The [Holy] Spirit and the bride say, ‘Come!’ And let
							him who hears say, ‘Come!’ Whoever is thirsty, let him
							come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of

							Jesus is with you now, speaking to your heart as you read

						<p>
							“Come!” He couldn’t be more eager, more insistent. If you
							have not yet done so, this moment above all others is your
							opportunity to explore His offer. Why not tell Him that

							with Him? Tell Him that you love Him. Thank Him for all
							He has done for you and all He is still planning for you.
							If there is something between you and God, ask Him to
