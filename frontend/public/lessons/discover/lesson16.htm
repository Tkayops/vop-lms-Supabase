					Just a few years ago some were predicting we would
					soon have more leisure time than we’d know what to
					do with. There were good reasons for those confident
					predictions. In the cities of the world computers were
					crunching through month-long tasks in fractions of a
					second. And robots had begun to handle the grueling jobs
					of heavy industry.
				</p>

				<p>
					But after the computers have been whirring and the
					automation automating, we’re more out of breath than
					ever. People are running out of time these days. Above all,
					families are running out of time. Husbands and wives find
					it hard to schedule “quality time” with the kids, much less
					with each other.
				</p>

				<p>
					One study in a small community showed that the average
					time per day that fathers spent alone with their very young
					sons was-37 seconds! Families are out of time and out of
					touch.
				</p>
				<p>
					How can we slow down enough to get in touch again?

					1. THE REMEDY FOR HIGH-TENSION LIVING
				</h2>

				<p>
					Jesus understands the problems of families under stress
					and He wants us to understand that spiritual rest is part of
					the quality of life:
				</p>



				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“COME TO ME, all you who are weary and burdened,
					and I WILL GIVE YOU REST. . . . LEARN FROM ME,
					for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find
					REST FOR YOUR SOULS.” -Matthew 11:28,29. (Unless
					otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER
					guides are from the New International Version of the
					Bible [NIV].)
				</p>

				<p>
					The Bible suggests we experience this kind of rest in two
					ways: coming to Christ on both a daily and a weekly basis.
				</p>


			</div>

			<!-- section 2 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					2. A DAILY LINK WITH JESUS
				</h2>

				<p>
					Crowds constantly clamored for Jesus’ attention. And
					yet Christ communicated a peaceful, tranquil spirit to
					everyone around Him. How? He invested time each day
					communing with His heavenly Father. He depended
					on His Father continually for resources to meet life’s
					challenges (John 6:57).
				</p>

				<p>
					If we are to live the serene, steady life that He did, we must
					continually depend on Jesus-let His Word and Spirit fill us
					and shape us. The best way to counter the forces burning
					us out as individuals and tearing us apart as families is to
					invest quality time with Christ. He tells us:
				</p>



				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“REMAIN IN ME, and I will remain in you. . . . APART FROM ME YOU CAN DO NOTHING.” -John 15:4,5.

				<p>
					One of the greatest needs of our time is for people to tap
					the spiritual resources available through forming a day
					by-day relationship with Jesus. One very important point
					that needs to be emphasized about our relationship with Christ is His
					f
					inished work on the cross. True rest, real security, can only
					exist because of the great accomplishment Jesus referred
					to when He cried out as He was dying: “It is finished”
					(John 19:30). In other words, His work of redeeming us
					was completed.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“But now he [Christ] has appeared ONCE FOR ALL . .
					. TO DO AWAY WITH SIN by the sacrifice of himself.” -Hebrews 9:26.
				</p>


				<p>
					When Jesus died, He did “away with sin.” That’s why it’s
					said that the believer who has confessed his or her sins can
					“rest” in the finished work of Christ. We’re accepted.
				</p>

				<p>
					Guilt lies behind much of the frantic pace of our lives today.
					But Jesus solved the guilt problem once and for all at the
					cross. Jesus’ cry, “It is finished,” sealed His promise of “I
					will give you rest” as an established fact. Christ completed
					the work of redeeming us at Calvary (Titus 2:14), then He
					rested in the tomb over the Sabbath, and rose from the
					grave Sunday morning as the Victor over sin and death.
					T
					he Christian can have no greater assurance than to rest
					in the finished work of Christ.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart IN FULL
					ASSURANCE OF FAITH, . . . Let us hold unswervingly
					to the hope we profess, for HE WHO PROMISED IS
					FAITHFUL.” -Hebrews 10:22, 23.
				</p>

				<p>
					Because He “who promised is faithful,” we can enter into
					the salvation-rest Jesus has promised. The stability, peace,
					and rest we experience in Jesus every day is a result not of
					anything we do, but of what He did at the cross.
				</p>

				<p>
					We can rest in Christ because our salvation is assured.
					T
					hat assurance motivates us to spend time with Christ
					each day, feeding on His Word and breathing in the
					atmosphere of heaven through prayer. A rendezvous with
					Jesus helps us turn a stressed-out lifestyle into a peaceful
					and purposeful life.

					3. A WEEKLY LINK WITH JESUS
				</h2>

				<p>
					After Christ created the world in six days (Colossians 1:16
					17), He provided Sabbath-rest. It is a weekly opportunity
					for us to cultivate our connection with Him.
				</p>


				<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
					<div class="col-span-3 space-y-2 text-justify  md:px-0">


						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.
							And there was evening, and there was morning-the sixth
							day. Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in
							all their vast array. By the seventh day God had finished
							the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he
							RESTED from all his work. And God BLESSED the
							seventh day and MADE IT HOLY, because on it he rested
							from all the work of creating that he had done.” -Genesis
							1:31-2:3.
						</p>

						<p>
							As their Creator, Jesus “rested” on the first Sabbath with
							Adam and Eve, and He “blessed” the Sabbath day and
							“made it holy.”
						</p>
						<p>
							God established a seven-day weekly cycle, not for His own
							benefit, but for Adam and Eve and for us today. Because
							He cared so much for the people He had made, He planned
							that every seventh day throughout their lives should be
							dedicated to seeking His
							presence. Each Sabbath,
							as He called it, was to be
							a day of both physical rest
							and spiritual refreshment.
							T
							he entrance of sin into
							our world only made the
							need for Sabbath rest
							more acute.
							T
							he same Savior who
							promised Adam and Eve
							“rest,” about two thousand
							years later gave the law to
							Moses on Mount Sinai (1
							Corinthians 10:1-4). Jesus
							chose to place the Sabbath
							rest commandment at
							the very heart of the Ten
							Commandments. The
							fourth commandment
							reads:
						</p>

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY BY KEEPING IT
							HOLY. Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
							but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God.
							On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your
							son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant,
							nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates.
							For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the
							earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he RESTED
							on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD BLESSED the
							Sabbath day and MADE IT HOLY.” - Exodus 20:8-11.
						</p>

						<p>
							God established the Sabbath as a day to “remember” the
							Lord who “made the heavens and the earth.” Sabbath-rest
							each week links us with the Creator who blessed this day
							and set it apart.

				<p>
					When Jesus lived on earth, He took advantage of every
					opportunity to sustain His union with the Father. He
					benefited from Sabbath-rest by worshiping on Sabbath, as
					Luke tells us:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and
					ON THE SABBATH DAY he went into the synagogue, AS
					WAS HIS CUSTOM.” -Luke 4:16.
				</p>

				<p>
					If the divine-human Jesus needed to rest in His Father’s
					presence on the Sabbath day, we human beings certainly
					need it more. When Jesus swept aside the legal restrictions
					the Jews had placed on the Sabbath (Matthew 12:1-12), He
					pointed out that God had made it to benefit people:
				</p>

				<p>
					“He said to them, ‘The Sabbath was made for man, not
					man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of
					the Sabbath.’” -Mark 2:27, 28.
				</p>

				<p>
					Jesus highlighted the importance of the Sabbath even in
					His death. He died on Friday, “the Preparation Day, and
					the Sabbath was about to begin” (Luke 23:54). At that
					moment He declared, “It is finished,” that is, His work
					of coming to this world and dying as substitute for the
					human race was complete (John 19:30; 4:34; 5:30). Then
					to celebrate His finished mission, Jesus rested in the tomb
					over the Sabbath. Just as Christ completed His work of
					creation on the sixth day and then rested on the seventh
					day, so through dying on the cross He completed His work
					of redemption on the sixth day, and then rested on the
					seventh.
				</p>

				<p>
					On Sunday morning Jesus came out from the tomb, a
					victorious Savior (Luke 24:1-7). He had already asked His
					disciples to maintain the Sabbath encounter with Him
					after His resurrection. Speaking of the destruction of
					Jerusalem, which took place nearly forty years after His
					death, He charged them:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on
					the Sabbath.” -Matthew 24:20.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our Savior wanted His disciples and their converts to
					continue the practices He had taught them (John 15:15,
					16). He wanted them to experience both salvation-rest and
					Sabbath-rest. They did not disappoint Him. The disciples
					continued to observe the Sabbath after Christ’s death (see
					Luke 23:54-56; Acts 13:14; 16:13; 17:2; 18:1-4).
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he beloved apostle John kept up his weekly link with
					Christ on the Sabbath day. In his later years he wrote,
					“On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit” (Revelation 1:10).
					According to Jesus, “the Lord’s Day” is the Sabbath, “for
					the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath” (Matthew 12:8).
					On the Sabbath we celebrate the Lord’s two greatest
					accomplishments on our behalf: creating us and saving us.
					This Sabbath experience will continue in heaven:
				</p>

				<p>
					“’As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will
					endure before me,’ declares the LORD, . . . ‘from one
					Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down
					before me,’ says the LORD.” -Isaiah 66:22,23.

					4. THE BENEFITS OF SABBATH-REST
				</h2>

				<p>
					People today are trampling over each other in their frantic
					life. Individuals are burning out. Families are falling apart
					under the strain. But God presents the Sabbath as a much
					better way to live the good life.
				</p>

				<p>
					Let’s look at some of the specific benefits of Sabbath-rest:
				</p>

				<div class="space-y-3 pl-6">
					<p>
						(1)The Sabbath is a memorial of creation, and by keeping
						it holy, we erect a memorial to our Creator. Its sacred
						hours offer a wonderful opportunity to get in touch
						with our roots in God’s created world. When was the
						last time you or your family took time to really soak
						in the quiet beauty of a forest path or rocky stream?
						T
						he Sabbath gives us time to spend with Jesus and
						catch glimpses of the wonders He has made for us.
					</p>

					<p>
						(2) On Sabbath we experience the joy of worship and
						fellowship with other Christians. There’s a benefit
						from praising God with others as a group of
						worshipers. The Sabbath gives us that special time
						of coming together as a church body to recharge our
						spiritual batteries.
					</p>

					<p>
						(3) The Sabbath provides occasions to perform
						thoughtful acts of kindness. Has a neighbor been sick
						during the week when you had no time to visit? When
						a friend needed a sympathetic ear after her husband’s
						death, did the pressure of daily living deprive her of
						your loving attention? Jesus advised: “It is lawful to
						do good on the Sabbath” (Matthew 12:12).
					</p>

					<p>
						(4) The Sabbath is a day to strengthen family ties. When
						Christ commanded, “On [the Sabbath] you shall not
						do any work” (Exodus 20:10). He couldn’t have given
						a better prescription to workaholic dads and stressed
						out moms. The Sabbath is a giant STOP sign for
						families. Stop letting the most urgent things crowd
						out the most important things. The Sabbath is one
						day when we can replace pressure with prayer, labor
						with laughter, busy schedules with quiet reflection.
						Sabbath-rest provides the entire family with time to
						link up with Christ and tap into His spiritual energy.
					</p>



					<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
						<div class="col-span-3 space-y-2 text-justify  md:px-0">

							<p>
								(5) The Sabbath is a time when Jesus comes especially
								near. Every relationship needs quality time, and our
								relationship with Christ is no exception. Devoting
								a whole day to Christ each week is a great way to
								keep our friendship with Him fresh and exciting.
								T
								he Sabbath gives us extra time for Bible study and
								prayer, extra time to simply be alone with Christ in a
								quiet place and listen. Jesus “blessed the seventh day
								and made it holy” with the promise of His presence
								(Genesis 2:3). You can understand why it is important
								to observe Saturday, the seventh day of the week as
								the Sabbath, because it is the day Christ set apart at
								creation to communicate with us in a special way
							</p>

						</div>

						<div class="flex justify-center items-start md:sticky md:top-8">
							<div class="relative group w-full sm:w-4/5 md:w-auto">
								<img src="lesson16_files/image004.gif" alt="Bible study illustration"
									class="w-full sm:w-3/4 md:w-full h-auto  object-cover" />
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>
						When Jesus created the Sabbath it almost seems that He
						had our generation in mind. It’s exactly what we need
						in our stress- filled environment: a day that is truly a
						complete break from everything else. A day to worship
						God, get in touch with creation again, and concentrate on
						relationships instead of things.
					</p>

					5. A FORETASTE OF HEAVENLY REST
				</h2>

				<p>
					We can sum up the benefits of linking up with Jesus
					through a daily and a weekly encounter in one wordrest.
					T
					he word “Sabbath” comes from a Hebrew word that
					means rest, so it’s not surprising that the Scripture calls
					the seventh day “a Sabbath of rest” (Leviticus 23:3).
				</p>


				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“[God] has spoken about the seventh day in these words:
					‘And on the seventh day God rested from all his work.’ . .
					. THERE
					REMAINS, THEN, A SABBATH-REST FOR THE
					PEOPLE OF GOD; . . . Let us, therefore, make every
					effort to enter that rest.” -Hebrews 4:4-11.
				</p>

				<p>
					Experiencing “Sabbath-rest” gives us a weekly foretaste of
					the joy we will experience in the perfect rest of heaven.
					T
					his rest isn’t just inactivity, it refers to the sense of
					security, peace and well-being that lie at the root of the
					truly abundant life. This kind of spiritual rest can be
					appreciated only through experience.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he testimony of those who have experienced salvation
					rest and Sabbath-rest is universal: “If you enter into the
					rest of Jesus through a daily and weekly connection with
					Him, you
				</p>

				<p>
					will discover the greatest joy in life.” Would you like to
					thank Jesus for His gift of rest? Would you like to thank
					Him for the promise of salvationrest each day to meet the
					challenges of life, and for the promise of Sabbath-rest each
					week to cement your relationship with Him? If you have
					never done so, would you like to accept the salvation He
					offers?
				</p>

				<p>
					Would you like to tell Him you desire to keep His Sabbath
					each week? Would you like to say, “Yes Lord! I desire to
					f
					ind delight in the day you have established.” Why not
					make that commitment right now?
				</p>

				<p>
					[You may be wondering: Who changed the Sabbath from
					Saturday, the seventh day of the week, to Sunday, the first
					day of the week? When was the change made? Did God
					authorize the change? These questions will be answered
					in Guide 21.]
