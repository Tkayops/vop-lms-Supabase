					After years of mistreatment, Armando Valladares
					was an emaciated, crippled shadow of his former
					self. He was serving a 30-year sentence in one of
					Castro’s prisons for praying in a church on Christmas
					Day. Prison officials starved, tortured, and humiliated
					the man, but he refused to give up his faith. Something
					kept him going: a promise he’d made to a young woman
					named Martha. They had met and fallen in love while he
					was in prison. She was deeply attracted to his passionate
					faith. Shortly after the couple married in a civil ceremony
					in the prison courtyard, Martha was forced to emigrate
					to Miami.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					heir separation was very painful. But Armando
					managed to smuggle out a promise to his beloved. On a
					tiny piece of discarded paper he scribbled his pledge: “I
					will come to you. The bayonets in the horizon beyond my
					back will no longer matter.”

				</p>

				<p>
					T
					his prisoner determined that somehow he and Martha
					would make their vows in a church before God. Someday
					their union would be complete. “You are always with me,”
					he told her. Armando’s promise kept him going through
					years of mistreatment that would have destroyed the
					spirit of most men.
				</p>

				<p>
					And it kept Martha going. She worked tirelessly to bring
					public attention to her husband’s plight. She never gave
					up hope.

					1. THE PROMISE
				</h2>


				<p>
					At times we may be tempted to wonder, will Christ
					really descend someday from this blue sky above us for
					a wonderful reunion? We’ve been separated for so long.
					Such a happy ending to the earth’s long, tragic history
					may appear just too good to be true. But there’s one thing
					that can keep hope alive in our hearts. And that’s simply
					Jesus’ promise to return. Just before departing from His
					disciples into heaven, Jesus made this pledge:
				</p>

				<p class="text-sm italic font-semibold">
					“Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust
					also in me. In my Father’s house are many rooms; if it
					were not so, I would have told you. I am going there
					to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a
					place for you, I WILL COME BACK and take you to
					be with me that you also may be where I am.” -John
					14:1-3. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in
					the DISCOVER guides are from the New International
					Version of the Bible [NIV].)
				</p>

				<p>
					Before Jesus ascended to heaven, He assured His followers, I WILL COME BACK!” He promised to return
					and take all who trust in Him to the special place He has
					prepared for us. Scripture speaks of His second coming
					approximately 2,500 times. The fact that Jesus is coming
					to the world a second time is as certain as the reality that
					He lived on this earth two thousand years ago.
				</p>


				<p>
					Long ago God promised that a Messiah would come, a
					Deliverer who would take on Himself our iniquities and
					provide pardon for human sin. That promise seemed too
					good to be true to many in the ancient world who were
					slogging through their lives. But Jesus did come and die
					on the cross. The promise came true more gloriously
					than people imagined possible. His promise to return
					will also come true. We can rely on the One who loves
					us, to return and gather up those for whom He has paid
					an infinite price.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					hroughout his imprisonment, Armando continued to
					smuggle poems, messages, and drawings to Martha. And
					she managed to publish some of these writings. Their
					eloquence attracted world attention. Governments began
					pressuring Castro to release prisoners of conscience. The
					French president intervened and at last in October of
					1982 Armando was placed on a plane headed for Paris.
					He hardly dared believe he was freeeven after the plane
					touched down. But then, after two decades of suffering
					and longing and waiting, Armando rushed into Martha’s
					arms.
				</p>

				<p>
					A few months later the happy couple stood in Miami’s
					St. Kieran Church and repeated their vows. At last
					their union was complete. The promise was fulfilled: “I
					will come to you.” Can you imagine what a wonderful
					reunion it will be when finally we are able to see Christ
					face-to-face? His glorious appearing will swallow up all
					our sorrows and frustrations, wipe away all the pain that
					we’ve kept hidden in our hearts. Jesus’ return will fulfill
					our deepest longings and most exciting expectations.
					And we’ll embark on an eternity of intimate union with
					the most wonderful personality in the Universe.
				</p>

				<p>
					Jesus is coming soon! Are you eager to meet Him?
				</p>

					2. HOW WILL JESUS COME?
				</h2>

				<p> (1) Will Jesus come in secret?</p>
				<div class="ml-3">
					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“See, I [Jesus] have told you ahead of time. So if
						anyone tells you, ‘There he is, out in the desert,’
						do not go out; or, ‘Here he is, in the inner rooms,’
						do not believe it. FOR AS LIGHTNING that comes from the east IS VISIBLE even in the
						west, SO WILL BE THE COMING OF THE
						SON OF MAN.” -Matthew 24:25-27.
					</p>

					<p>
						Lightning flashes out very visibly for great
						distances, so the coming of Jesus will not be some
						secret or subjective event.
					</p>


				</div>

				<p>
					(2) Will Jesus come again as a real person?
				</p>
				<div class="ml-3">
					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“They [Jesus’ followers] were looking intently up
						into the sky as he [Jesus] was going, when
						suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside
						them. ‘Men of Galilee,’ they said, ‘why do you
						stand here looking into the sky? THIS SAME
						JESUS, who has been TAKEN from you INTO
						HEAVEN, WILL COME BACK IN THE SAME
						WAY you have seen him go into heaven.’” -Acts 1:10-11.
					</p>

					<p>
						On the day of His departure from our world the
						angels assured the disciples that the “same Jesus”
						taken up into heaven-not someone else-would
						come back in person as King of Kings. The same
						Jesus who healed the sick and opened blind eyes.
						T
						he same Jesus who spoke gently to the woman
						taken in adultery. The same Jesus who wiped away
						mourner’s tears and welcomed children into His
						lap. The same Jesus who died on Calvary’s cross,
						rested in the grave, and rose from the dead the
						third day.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p> (3) Will Jesus come so we can see Him?</p>
				<div class="ml-3">
					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“Look, he is coming with the clouds, and EVERY
						EYE WILL SEE HIM.” -Revelation 1:7
						(first part).
					</p>

					<p>
						All who are alive when Jesus comes again, both the
						righteous and the wicked, will witness His return.
						How many did Jesus Himself say would view His
						return?
					</p>

					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“At that time the sign of the Son of Man will
						appear in the sky, and ALL THE NATIONS OF
						THE EARTH will mourn. THEY WILL SEE the
						Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky,
						with power and great glory.” - Matthew 24:30.
					</p>

					<p>
						Every living person on our globe will see Jesus
						return.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p> (4) Who will accompany Jesus when He comes?</p>
				<div class="ml-3">
					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all
						the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in
						heavenly glory.” -Matthew 25:31.
					</p>

					<p>
						Imagine what it will be like when Jesus returns in
						all His splendor surrounded by “all the angels.”
					</p>
				</div>

				<p> (5) Can we predict the exact time of Jesus’ return?</p>
				<div class="ml-3">
					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“No one knows about that day or hour, not even
						the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the
						Father....So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not
						expect him.” - Matthew 24:36, 44.
					</p>

					<p>
						Everyone will see Jesus’ glorious arrival, but many
						will be unprepared for it. Are you personally ready
						for Jesus to come?

					3. WHAT WILL JESUS DO WHEN HE COMES
					AGAIN?
				</h2>

				<p> (1) Jesus will gather all the saved (the elect).</p>
				<div class="ml-3">
					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet
						call, and they will gather his elect from the four
						winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.” -Matthew 24:31.
					</p>

					<p>
						If you have allowed Jesus to prepare you in heart
						and life, you will greet Him joyfully as your
						Savior.
					</p>


				</div>

				<p>(2) Jesus will awaken the righteous dead.</p>
				<div class="ml-3">
					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“For the Lord himself will come down from
						heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of
						the archangel and with the trumpet call of God,
						and THE DEAD IN CHRIST WILL RISE FIRST.” -1 Thessalonians 4:16.
					</p>

					<p>
						Jesus descends from heaven with a shout. His
						mighty voice is heard around the world. It breaks
						open graves in every cemetery and resurrects
						millions of people who have accepted Jesus
						through the ages. What an exhilarating day that
						will be!
					</p>


				</div>

				<p> (3) Jesus will transform all the righteous at His
					coming-not only the righteous dead, but also the
					righteous living.</p>

				<div class="ml-3">
					<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
						“After that, we who are still alive and are left
						WILL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER WITH
						THEM in the clouds to meet the Lord in the
						air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.” -Verse 17.
					</p>

					<p>
						To prepare us for eternity, Christ changes our
						mortal bodies that are subject to death into
						beautiful immortal bodies.
					</p>

					<p class="font-semibold italic text-sm">
						“Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep,
						but WE WILL ALL BE CHANGED-in a flash, in
						the twinkling of an eye, AT THE LAST TRUMPET.
						For the trumpet will sound, THE DEAD WILL
						BE RAISED IMPERISHABLE, and WE WILL
						BE CHANGED. For the perishable must clothe
						itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with
						immortality.” -1 Corinthians 15:51-53.
					</p>

					<p>
						When Jesus comes “we will all be changed.” Just
						think: no more arthritis, paralysis, or cancer. Shut
						down the hospitals and close up the funeral homes.
						Christ has come!
					</p>


				</div>

				<p>
					(4) Jesus will take all the righteous people to heaven Jesus Himself made the promise, “I will come
					back
					and take you to be with me” in My Father’s house
					(see John 14:1-3). Peter speaks of the inheritance
					of the redeemed “kept in heaven for you” (1 Peter
					1:4). We can look forward to exploring the marvels
					of God’s city, the New Jerusalem, and getting to
					know our heavenly Father.
				</p>

				<p>
					(5) Jesus will eliminate evil and suffering for all time.
					T
					he wicked-those who have persistently rejected
					all of Jesus’ offers of mercy-actually pass sentence
					on themselves. As they stare at Jesus’ face coming
					toward them from the clouds, a sudden awareness
					of their sin proves too painful to bear; they cry to
					the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us
					from the face of him who sits on the throne and
					from the wrath of the Lamb!” (Revelation 6:16).
					T
					hey prefer death to standing before Jesus’ all
					seeing gaze.
				</p>
				<p>
					T
					hey know that the voice now thundering from
					the sky once tenderly implored them to accept
					divine grace.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					hose who lost themselves in the mad rush after
					money or pleasure or position now realize they’ve
					neglected the only really worthwhile thing in life.
				</p>

				<p>
					It is a crushing revelation. After all, not one of
					them needed to be lost. God Himself finds “no
					pleasure in the death of the wicked” (Ezekiel
					33:11). He is “not wanting anyone to perish, but
					everyone to come to repentance” (2 Peter 3:9).
					Jesus implores us, “Come to me, all you who are
					weary and burdened, and I will give you rest”
					(Matthew 11:28). But, incredibly, some turn aside
					His gracious invitation.
				</p>

					4. ARE YOU READY FOR JESUS TO COME?
				</h2>

				<p>
					It cost Jesus a great deal to guarantee us a glorious future
					with Him “in my Father’s house.” It cost Him His life!
				</p>

				<p>
					“CHRIST WAS SACRIFICED ONCE to take away the
					sins of many people; and HE WILL APPEAR A SECOND
					TIME, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who
					are waiting for him.” -Hebrews 9:28.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he Savior who died on the cross to take away your sins
					will appear “a second time,” and He will “bring salvation
					to those who are waiting for him.” Christ sacrificed
					Himself in order to offer salvation to each of us.
				</p>

				<p>
					But without the Second Coming, the cross would be a
					failure. Christ wants to give us an eternally secure home
					with Him. In order for that to happen, we must allow
					Him to rule in our hearts as Savior and Lord right now.
				</p>

				<p>
					On the morning of August 16, 1945 a small boy ran
					through the Shantung Compound in North China
					shouting that he’d spotted a plane in the sky. All the
					able-bodied internees ran outside and looked up. These men and women had suffered through years of
					isolation,
					deprivation, and anxiety, imprisoned by the Japanese as
					citizens of enemy nations. For many only one thing had
					kept them spiritually alive: the hope that someday the
					war would end.
				</p>

				<p>
					An electric current shot through that crowd of 1500
					surviving internees as they realized this plane might
					be coming for THEM. As the hum of the aircraft grew
					louder, someone yelled, “Look, there’s the AMERICAN
					FLAG painted on the side!” And then in an unbelieving
					daze, voices cried out, “Look, they’re WAVING at us!
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					hey know who we are. They’re coming to get us.”
				</p>

				<p>
					At this point the excitement was more than these ragged,
					weary, homesick survivors could contain. Pandemonium
					broke loose. People were running in circles, shouting at
					the top of their lungs, waving their arms and weeping.
				</p>

				<p>
					Suddenly the crowd gasped and stared in silence. The
					underside of the plane suddenly opened and men began
					f
					loating down in parachutes. Their rescuers weren’t just
					coming someday; they were coming today, NOW to be
					in their midst!
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he crowd surged toward the compound gate. No one
					paused to think of the machine guns pointed down
					from towers. After years of frustration and loneliness,
					they broke through the gate and rushed to where the
					paratroopers were landing.
				</p>

				<p>
					Soon this flood of humanity turned and poured back
					into camp-with the soldiers on their shoulders. The camp
					commander surrendered without a fight. The war was
					indeed over. Freedom had come. The world was brand
					new again.
				</p>

				<p>
					Soon OUR God, OUR Savior, will descend from the
					clouds to rescue us. The long horror story of man’s cruelty
					to man will finally cease. There will be jubilation on that
					day, shouts of joy as we finally understand:
				</p>

				<p>
					“He’s coming close; I can see the angels blowing their
					trumpets.” The sound gets louder, the cloud of glory
					brighter, until we can hardly endure it. But we can’t stop
					looking as we realize: “He sees me. He knows who I am.”
					We’ll know with indescribable joy: “This is my God. He’s
					coming for me, not someday, but today, right now.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Are you ready to welcome the King in all His glory? If not,
					please invite Jesus personally into your life just now. Even
					as the coming of Jesus to our world will solve the world’s
					problems, so His coming into your heart will help you
					deal with your present daily problems. The great Problem
					Solver can deliver you from the guilt and burden of sin
					and give you eternal life.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he coming of Jesus into a life can forever change it as
					dramatically as the coming of Jesus to our world will
					transform it. You can depend on Jesus. He will prepare
					you for His coming and give you the wonderful assurance
					of a life of eternal happiness.
