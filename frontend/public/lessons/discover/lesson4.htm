					After a minister had spoken on the subject, “Why I Believe
					in Jesus,” a well-dressed young man paid him a visit in his
					study and remarked, “Your talk tonight was interesting,
					but everything you said about Christ came out of your Bible.
					Tell me, if Jesus ever lived on this earth, why doesn’t history tell
					about Him?”
				</p>

				<p>
					“That’s a fair question,” the minister answered as he turned and
					took down several books. “But as a matter of fact, history does
					tell about Jesus Christ.”
				</p>
				<p>
					“That I’d like to see for myself,” the young man responded.
				</p>

				<p>
					“Well here is Letter 97 of Book 10 of Letters of Pliny the
					Younger, Roman proconsul in Bithynia, a province of old Asia
					Minor. Pliny wrote to the Roman Emperor, Trajan, telling him
					about events in his province. See, here he is asking counsel on
					how he should handle a new sect, the Christians. He tells of
					their rapid growth and of how they sang hymns composed to
					their leader, Christ. Pliny sent his letter about A.D. 110. The
					letter by Pliny offers historical evidence of the man, Christ, and
					of the spread of His faith in the days of His apostles.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Surprised, the young man said, “Tell me more!”
				</p>

				<p>
					As the minister thumbed through another book, he added,
					“Another historian, contemporary with Pliny, was Tacitus. In
					his Annals (Book 15, chapter 44) he tells of Nero’s hatred for,
					and persecution of, the Christians at the time of the burning
					of Rome. Tacitus explains that the term ‘Christian’ comes from
					the name ‘Christ.’ He mentions that Jesus Christ, the founder of
					the Christian religion, had been put to death by Pontius Pilate,
					Procurator of Judea, during the reign of Emperor Tiberius.
					All these details that Tacitus gives us match exactly the events,
					names, and places given in the Bible.”
				</p>

				<p>
					“Pastor, I never knew things like that were in secular history!”
					the visitor exclaimed.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he minister added, “I want you to notice that about A.D.
					180 Celsus wrote a book attacking Christians, indicating that
					Christianity by that time had become a force to reckon with.
				</p>

				<p>
					“If you are still in doubt, remember that the four Gospels are
					just as much history as these secular books.”
				</p>

				<p>
					When this young man realized that both sacred and secular
					history agree that Jesus did live as a man on earth, he went
					away convinced that Jesus Christ was a real, historical figure.

					1. CHRIST EXISTED FROM ETERNITY
				</h2>

				<p>
					Jesus was not merely a good man, He was also God. What
					claim did Jesus Himself make concerning His divinity?

				<p>
					“If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well.
					From now on, you do know him and have seen him... Anyone
					who has seen me has seen the Father.” -John 14:7-9. (Unless
					otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides
					are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)
				</p>
				<p>
					If you wish to know the answer to the questions, “Who is God?

					2. CHRIST, THE HEART OF HISTORY AND PROPHECY
				</h2>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					Since Christ’s life story is a fulfillment of prophecy, His
					life story was written before He was born. Old Testament
					prophecies present a clear outline of Christ’s life, death, and
					resurrection in advance. The New Testament is His life story
					told in fulfillment.
				</p>

				<p>
					Living from five hundred to fifteen hundred years before
					Christ’s birth, the Old Testament prophets made scores of
					very specific predictions about the life of the Messiah. And
					at the very beginning of Christ’s earthly ministry, as people
					compared His life with Old Testament prophecies, what did
					they conclude?
				</p>

				<p class="text-sm font-semibold italic">
					“We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and
					about whom the prophets also wrote-Jesus of Nazareth, the
					son of Joseph.” -John 1:45.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our Savior appealed to fulfilled prophecies to establish His
					identity:
				</p>

				<p class="text-sm font-semibold italic">
					“And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained
					to them what was said in all the [Old Testament] Scriptures
					concerning himself.” -Luke 24:25-27.
				</p>

				<p>
					Fulfilled prophecies give convincing evidence that Jesus is the
					promised Messiah.

					4. A GOD-PLANNED LIFE
				</h2>

				<p>
					Jesus lived a God-planned life, one outlined hundreds of years
					before His birth. Always conscious of this fact, He remained
					sensitive to God’s leading. Christ said:
				</p>

				<p class="italic text-sm font-semibold">
					“I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has
					taught me. . . . for I always do what pleases him.” -John 8:28,
					29.
				</p>

				<p>
					God planned the human life of Jesus before His birth, and God
					also has a plan for every human being. He knows how each of
					us can fulfill our deepest desires and find an abundant life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ray wasn’t always so sure he wanted to submit to God’s plan.
					But when he faced a big decision about where to go to college,
					he decided for the first time in his life to seek divine guidance
					on the subject. He prayed for several days and tried to listen for
					some answer. After a while he seemed to get very clear reasons
					on why he should choose Option B: a less expensive, but huge
					and impersonal university. Soon after starting classes he got
					acquainted with some wonderful Christians who belonged to
					Campus Crusade for Christ. His experience with them during
					the next two years radically changed his life
				</p>

				<p>
					When Ray looks back today, he notes that every time he has
					faced a major decision and sought divine guidance, “God
					opened up a whole new area of my life.”
				</p>
				<p>
					How can you know God’s plan for your life? God guides in
					several ways:
				</p>


				<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4">

						<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-5">
							<li>
								<h5 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">THE BIBLE</h5>
								<p>According to the psalmist, what is life’s Guidebook?</p>

								<p>
									“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.”
									<span class="italic">-Psalm 119:105</span>
								</p>

								<p>
									God’s Word renews our minds and gives us insight (Romans 12:2, Psalm 119:99).
									A regular time of prayerful study in Scripture is the best way to get our
									priorities straight.
								</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<h5 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">PROVIDENTIAL CIRCUMSTANCES</h5>
								<p>
									God also guides us by divinely-directed circumstances. Psalm 23 pictures Him as
									the Good Shepherd. A shepherd leads his sheep through lush valleys as well as
									through rocky ravines. He is capable of helping his charges benefit and learn
									from every experience. We have a Shepherd who sticks close by our side.
								</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<h5 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">
									DIRECT COMMUNICATION OF GOD TO THE HEART
								</h5>

								<p class="font-semibold text-sm italic">
									God also guides us by speaking to our conscience. The Spirit can enlighten
									“the eyes of your heart” (Ephesians 1:18).
								</p>

								<p>
									The more consistently we practice communicating with God, the more He is able
									to guide us. He molds both our inner impressions and our reasoning and judgment
									so we can see clearly the next step we need to take.

					5. THE GUIDES MUST HARMONIZE
				</h2>

				<p class="text-sm font-semibold italic">
					It’s possible, of course, to assume you are living a God-directed
					life when you are merely following your own inclinations and
					impulses (Proverbs 16:25). Our feelings must harmonize with
					Bible teaching. It’s not safe to conclude that God is leading us
					unless all three of the guides harmonize.
				</p>

				<p>
					Take Jake, for example. He had a lovely wife and two children,
					but had an affair with another woman. He told his friends: “I’ve
					prayed about it and I feel it’s God’s will.” Jake’s emotions and
					“inner impressions” clearly sent him down the wrong path.
					He imagined that it was “providential” that he’d met this other
					woman and didn’t step back to look at the Bible commands
					against adultery. And the Bible, “the law and the testimony,” is
					the authoritative guidebook, the final judge for determining a
					right course of action (Isaiah 8:20). We must never allow any
					impression or apparently providential circumstance lead us
					away from a biblical principle.
				</p>


			</div>


			<!-- section 6 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					6.SUBMITTING TO GOD’S PLAN
				</h2>

				<p>
					When the Devil came to tempt Jesus in the wilderness, he
					suggested, “If you will only forego the painful sacrifices your
					Father has planned for you, I’ll give you the world in the palm
					of your hand-with fame, fortune, and a comfortable lifestyle.”
					Satan even quoted Scripture in an attempt to lead Jesus astray.
					But each time Jesus fought him off with the words, “It is
					written” (Matthew 4:1-11).
				</p>

				<p>
					One powerful lesson we can learn from the life of Jesus is
					submission to the Father’s will. Even amid the terrible agony
					of Gethsemane, He cried out, “My Father, if it is possible, may
					this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will”
					(Matthew 26:39). After three years of His ministry, living day
					by day in harmony with the Father’s plan, Christ’s dying words
					were: “It is finished” (John 19:30). Jesus was really saying, “My
					God-planned life is now complete and fulfilled.”
				</p>

				<p>
					As you begin to hear God’s voice speaking coherently through
					His Word, providential circumstances, and direct impressions,
					you can learn to accept His guidance wholeheartedly. You too
					can discover the joy of a God-planned and a God-guided life.
