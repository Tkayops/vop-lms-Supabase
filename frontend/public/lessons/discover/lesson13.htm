					There were no fingerprints. No weapon was ever
					discovered. No one saw the murderer enter the
					office of the doctor. No one even heard the shots
					ring out. But the doctor was found sprawled behind his
					desk. Five bullets had pierced his shirt. It seemed the
					perfect crime. The police at first could find no clues. But
					then they noticed a tiny wire attached to a pencil holder
					on the doctor’s desk. The wire led to a tape recorder in
					a desk drawer. The pencil holder, they realized, actually
					concealed a microphone that the doctor used to record
					his conversations with the patients he was counseling.
				</p>

				<p>
					The investigators quickly rewound the tape and, to their
					amazement, began to listen to a replay of the actual crime.
					A man named Anthony had entered the office and began
					a heated argument with the doctor. Shots rang out. The
					tape ended with the terrible moans of the doctor, dying
					on the carpet. Every awful detail had been recorded.
					The murderer thought his crime would forever remain
					a secret. He’d been so careful to leave no clues. But the
					tape told the whole story. In this guide we’re going to
					learn about God’s final judgment when human beings
					are “judged according to what they had done as recorded
					in the books” (Revelation 20:12). For those who have not
					accepted Christ as their Savior, it will be bad news. But
					the judgment is wonderfully good news for those who’ve
					found security in Christ.

					1. HOW YOU CAN FACE THE JUDGMENT
					UNAFRAID
				</h2>

				<p>
					Who will judge the world?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“The Father judges no one, but has entrusted all
					judgment to the Son.”-John 5:22. (Unless otherwise
					noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are
					from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)
				</p>

				<p>
					How did the cross prepare Christ to become our Judge?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“God presented him [Jesus] as a sacrifice of atonement,
					through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate
					his justice, . . . so as to be JUST AND THE ONE
					WHO JUSTIFIES those who have faith in Jesus.” -Romans 3:25, 26.
				</p>

				<p>
					Christ’s death as our substitute enables Him to act as both
					a just Judge and a gracious Justifier who can forgive the
					repentant sinner. When the watching universe asks the
					question, “How can an impartial judge declare a guilty
					person not guilty?” Christ can answer by pointing to the scars in His hands. He has received the
					just penalty for
					our sins in His own body. The books of heaven preserve
					a record of every individual life, and these records are
					utilized in the judgment (Revelation 20:12). That’s the
					bad news for those who imagine their secret sins and
					crimes will never return to haunt them. But there is
					wonderfully good news for all who’ve sincerely accepted
					Christ as their Advocate in heaven: “The blood of Jesus...
					purifies us from all sin” (1 John 1:7)
				</p>

				<p>
					What does Jesus offer in exchange for our life of sin?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“God made him [Christ] who had no sin to be sin for
					us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of
					God.” -2 Corinthians. 5:21
				</p>

				<p>
					Our life of sin is exchanged for Christ’s perfect life of
					righteousness. Because of Jesus’ sinless life and death,
					God can forgive us and treat us as if we’d never sinned.
					What qualifies Jesus to be our Advocate and Judge?

					2. CHRIST CAME ON TIME
				</h2>

				<p>
					At His baptism, Jesus was anointed by the Holy Spirit:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the
					water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he
					saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and
					lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, ‘This
					is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.’” -Matthew 3:16, 17.
				</p>

				<p>
					Following Christ’s anointing by the Holy Spirit at His
					baptism, the disciples announced:
				</p>



				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“’We have found the Messiah’ [the Christ].” -John 1:41.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he disciples knew that the Hebrew word “Messiah” and
					the Greek word “Christ” both mean “the Anointed One.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Luke, a disciple of Jesus, recorded the date of Jesus’
					anointing as the Messiah as the fifteenth year of Tiberius
					Caesar (Luke 3:1). To us that would be the year A.D.
					27. More than 500 years before Jesus came the prophet
					Daniel predicted that Jesus would be anointed as the
					Messiah in A.D. 27:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild
					Jerusalem until the Anointed One, . . . will be seven
					‘sevens’ [weeks, Hebrew] and sixty-two ‘sevens’
					[weeks].”-Daniel 9:25.
				</p>

				<p>
					Seven weeks and sixty-two weeks total sixty-nine weeks
					or 483 days (7 X 69 = 483 days). In symbolic Bible prophecy each day equals one year (Ezekiel 4:6;
					Numbers
					14:34), so the 483 days equal 483 years. Daniel predicted
					that a command would go forth to restore and rebuild
					Jerusalem, and exactly 483 years after this command, the
					Messiah would appear.
				</p>

				<p>
					Did Jesus appear as the Messiah at the appointed time?
					Artaxerxes issued the decree to rebuild Jerusalem in 457
					B.C. (Ezra 7:7-26). The 483 years, then, ended in A.D.
					27. (457 B.C. + A.D. 27 = 484.) The decree went forth
					during the year 457 and Christ was anointed during
					A.D. 27, making them both partial years, so the correct
					time would be 483 years. At the very time appointed,
					in A.D. 27, Jesus appeared with the message: “The time
					has come” (Mark 1:15). The accurate fulfillment of this
					Bible prophecy is impressive confirmation that Jesus of
					Nazareth is indeed the Messiah, God in human flesh.
				</p>

				<p>
					How long was Jesus to confirm the promise?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“He will confirm a covenant [a promise] with many for
					one ‘seven’ [week, Hebrew].” -Daniel 9:27, first part.

				<p>
					Jesus was crucified in A.D. 31, in “the middle of the
					week.” At the moment of Christ’s death, God tore “the
					curtain of the temple . . . in two from top to bottom”
					(Matthew 27:51). The sacrificial offering about to be slain
					(a symbol of Jesus “the Lamb of God”) escaped from the
					priest’s hands. This was a sign that God no longer wanted
					humanity to offer animal sacrifices. Fulfilling prophecy
					down to the letter, Jesus “put an end to” any need for
					further sacrifices to be offered. Since Christ’s death,
					people gain access to God not through animal sacrifices
					and human priests, but through the Messiah, the Lamb
					of God and our High Priest

					3. THE ASSURANCE OF SINS FORGIVEN
				</h2>

				<p>
					According to Daniel’s prophecy, why did Jesus die?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“The Anointed One will be cut off but not for himself.” -Daniel 9:26, margin.
				</p>

				<p>
					At his death on the cross, Jesus was “cut off.” He died,
					“but not for himself,” not to pay a penalty for His own sin,
					but to pay the penalty for sins of the entire world.
				</p>

				<p>
					How can we know that God has forgiven all our sins?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus
					Christ to all who believe...ALL HAVE SINNED..., and
					are JUSTIFIED freely BY HIS GRACE through the
					redemption that came by Christ Jesus...THROUGH
					FAITH IN HIS BLOOD.” -Romans 3:22-25.
				</p>

				<p>
					The key points in these verses are: We “all have sinned,”
					but because of God’s “grace,” all “are justified” who have
					“faith” in the cleansing power of Christ’s “blood.” When
					we are justified, God declares us not guilty, taking away
					the guilt of our past sins. And God declares us righteous;
					“righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus
					Christ.” All of us who are worn out by the struggle to be
					good enough, to measure up on our own, can find real
					rest in Christ’s gracious acceptance. He promises, “Come
					to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give
					you rest” (Matthew 11:28). All of us who are burdened by
					scars from the past and by an aching sense of inadequacy
					and shame, can find peace and wholeness in Christ.

					4. THE TIME FOR THE JUDGMENT TO BEGIN
				</h2>

				<p>
					In the eighth chapter of Daniel an angel showed the
					prophet a great panorama of the future. Daniel saw (1) a
					ram, (2) a he-goat, and (3) out of one of the horns of the
					he-goat, “another horn which started small and grew in
					power” (Daniel 9:8, 9); symbols representing (1) Medo
					Persia, (2) Greece, and (3) Rome (Daniel 8:1-12, 20-26).
				</p>

				<p>
					What is the fourth part of the prophecy?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“’How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled-the
					vision concerning the daily sacrifice...?’ He said to me,
					‘It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings [or days,
					Hebrew]; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated
					[cleansed].’” -Daniel 8:13, 14.
				</p>

				<p>
					Daniel fainted before the angel could explain the 2,300
					day part of the prophecy, and the eighth chapter closes
					with no interpretation of it. But later the angel reappeared
					and stated:
				</p>


				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Understand the vision: seventy ‘sevens’ [weeks,
					Hebrew] are decreed [cut off, Hebrew] for your people
					and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end
					to sin, to atone for wickedness.” -Daniel 9:22-24.
				</p>

				<p>
					T he 2,300 days are, of course, 2,300 years, each day
					standing for a year (Ezekiel 4:6). Seventy weeks, or 490
					years, constituted the first section of the longer period
					of 2,300 years. Both time periods started in 457 B.C. when Persia issued the decree “to restore and
					rebuild
					Jerusalem.” Subtracting 490 years from the 2,300 years,
					leaves 1,810. Adding 1,810 years to A.D. 34, when the 490
					years ended, brings us to A.D. 1844.

					5. THE HEAVENLY SANCTUARY
					CLEANSED-A JUDGMENT
				</h2>

				<p>
					T
					he angel told Daniel that in 1844, at the end of the 2,300
					years, “the sanctuary will be cleansed” (Daniel 8:14,
					KJV). But what does that mean? Since A.D. 70 when
					the Romans destroyed the temple at Jerusalem, God’s
					people have had no temple on earth. So the sanctuary to
					be cleansed, beginning in 1844, has to be the heavenly
					sanctuary of which the earthly temple was a replica. Now,
					what does the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary mean?
					Ancient Israel called the day for cleansing the earthly
					sanctuary Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. It was
					really a day of judgment. As we discovered in Guide 12,
					Christ’s activity for us in the sanctuary has two phases:
					(1) The daily sacrifices focus on the priest’s ministry in
					the first room of the sanctuary, the Holy Place. (2) The
					yearly sacrifice concentrates on the High Priest’s ministry
					in the second room, the Most Holy Place (Leviticus 16).
				</p>


				<p>
					In the earthly sanctuary, as people confessed their
					sins day by day, the blood of slaughtered animals was
					sprinkled on the corner of the altar, then transferred
					to the Holy Place (Leviticus 4 and 6). Thus, in symbol,
					day after day the confessed sins were brought into the
					sanctuary and laid up there. Then each year, on the Day
					of Atonement, the sanctuary was cleansed from all sins
					confessed during the past year (Leviticus 16). To effect
					this cleansing, the High Priest made a special sacrifice
					of a consecrated goat. He then carried its blood into
					the Most Holy Place and sprinkled this cleansing blood
					before the atonement cover to show that the blood of
					Jesus, the coming Redeemer, would pay the penalty for
					sin.
				</p>

				<p>
					The High Priest then symbolically removed the confessed
					sins from the sanctuary and placed them on the head of
					another goat, which was led out into the wilderness to die
					(Leviticus 16:20-22). This ceremony on the yearly Day of
					Atonement cleansed the sanctuary from sin. The people
					regarded it as a day of judgment because those who
					refused to confess their sins were considered unrighteous

							and were “cut off from [God’s] people” ( 23:29). What
							the High Priest did symbolically once a year, Jesus does
							once for all time as our High Priest (Hebrews 9:6-12). In
							the great judgment day He removes from the sanctuary
							the confessed sins of all who have accepted Him as their
							Savior. If we have confessed our sins, He will forever blot
							out the record of our sins at that time (Acts 3:19). This
							ministry is the work of judgment that Jesus began in
							1844. In 1844 when the hour of God’s judgment began in
							heaven, a judgment hour message began to be preached
							throughout the world (Revelation 14:6-7). A future

					6. FACING YOUR LIFE RECORD IN THE
					JUDGMENT
				</h2>

				<p>
					Since 1844 Christ, as Judge, has been investigating the
					record of each person who has ever lived to confirm who
					will be among the saved when Jesus comes. As our Judge,
					Jesus “wipes out” all of the sins of the righteous from their
					life record in heaven (Acts 3:19). When your name comes
					up in judgment, it will be easy to face your life record
					IF you’ve accepted Christ as your Substitute. And when
					the judgment of the righteous is finished, Jesus returns
					to earth to reward them (Revelation 22:12, 14). Are you
					ready for Jesus to come? Or is there something you’ve
					been hiding from Him? Do you have an open and honest
					relationship with the One who promises:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and
					will forgive us our sins and purify us from all
					unrighteousness.” -1 John 1:9.
				</p>

				<p>
					Confession simply means agreeing to face our sins,
					accept God’s forgiveness, and acknowledge our need of
					His power and grace. While visiting a prison in Potsdam,
					King Frederick William I listened to a number of pleas
					for pardon. All the inmates swore that prejudiced
					judges, perjured witnesses, or unscrupulous lawyers
					were responsible for their imprisonment. From cell to
					cell the same story of wronged innocence continued.
					But at one cell the inmate had nothing to say. Surprised,
					Frederick joked, “I suppose you are innocent too.” “No
					your Majesty,” the man answered, “I am guilty and richly
					deserve all that I get.” The king turned to the guard and
					called out loudly, “Come and release this rascal quickly,
					before he corrupts this fine lot of innocent people.”
				</p>

				<p>
					How do we prepare for the judgment? How do we get
					ready for Christ to come? Simply by an honest confession
					of the truth: I richly deserve the penalty of death for my
					sins, but Another has taken my place and given me a
					wonderful pardon. Make a commitment right now that
					whatever happens, you’ll keep your relationship with
					Christ eye-to-eye honest and heart-to-heart sincere.
