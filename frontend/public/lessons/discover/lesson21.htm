					I n Guide 16 we discovered that experiencing Sabbath rest
					is an important antidote to today’s stressful living. Since
					God understands our every need, He established each
					seventh day for our physical rest and our spiritual refreshment.
					After creating our world in six days, He “rested” on the seventh
					day, “blessed” and “made it holy” (Genesis 2:1-3).
				</p>

				<p>
					When God gave the Ten Commandments to His people, Israel,
					He placed the commandment to observe the seventh-day
					Sabbath at the heart of His law (Exodus 20:8-11).
				</p>

				<p>
					According to this commandment, the Sabbath is a memorial
					of God’s creative power, a day to pause and think about the
					beauties and wonders of His created works, a day to relax and
					come close to our Creator, a day to explore in greater depth our
					relationship with Him.
				</p>

				<p>
					During Jesus’ human life on earth, He too kept the Sabbath
					(Luke 4:16) and endorsed it as a day that benefits Christians
					(Mark 2:27, 28). Several texts in the book of Acts make it clear
					that Christ’s disciples worshiped on the Sabbath after His
					resurrection (Acts 13:14; 16:13; 17:2; 18:1-4, 11).

					1. A PUZZLING QUESTION
				</h2>

				<p>
					T
					his brings us to a subject that many find perplexing. The
					Christian world has for some time observed two different
					days. On one hand, most Christians sincerely observe Sunday,
					the first day of the week, which they believe to be a memorial
					of Christ’s resurrection. On the other hand, a large group of
					Christians, equally sincere, believe that the Bible honors
					only the seventh-day as the Sabbath and nowhere affirms the
					sanctity of Sunday.
				</p>

				<p>
					Does it really make any difference which day we observe as the
					Sabbath? As sincere and earnest people who want to know the
					truth, we must always ask ourselves: “What matters to Jesus?
					What does Jesus desire me to do?”
				</p>

				<p>
					In coming to a decision about this, several important facts need
					to be made clear: Who changed the Sabbath from Saturday, the
					seventh day of the week, to Sunday, the first day of the week?
					Does the Bible authorize such a shift? If so, did God, Christ, or
					perhaps the apostles make the change?
				</p>

				<p>
					We’ll proceed by looking at all the possibilities.
				</p>

				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					2. DID GOD CHANGE THE DAY?
				</h2>
				<p>
					Is there any pronouncement from God that changes the
					Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week?
				</p>

				<p>
					Most Christians accept the Ten Commandments as a valid guide
					to live by. They are the only message God has ever personally
					written out for the human race. They are so important, He wrote them on stone with His own finger
					(Exodus 31:18).
					In the fourth commandment God instructs us:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you
					shall labor and do all your work, but THE SEVENTH DAY
					IS THE SABBATH TO THE LORD YOUR GOD. On it you
					shall not do any work. . . . For in six days the LORD made
					the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them,
					but he RESTED on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD
					BLESSED the Sabbath day and MADE IT HOLY.” -Exodus
					20:8- 11. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the
					DISCOVER guides are from the New International Version of
					the Bible [NIV].)
				</p>

				<p>
					When God gave the Ten Commandments to His people, He
					also made it clear that no human being should revise or edit
					the instruction from His holy lips
				</p>


				<p>
					“DO NOT ADD to what I command you and DO NOT
					SUBTRACT from it, but keep the commands of the LORD
					your God that I give you.” -Deuteronomy 4:2.
					God Himself pledges not to alter His commands
				</p>

				<p>
					“I WILL NOT violate my covenant or ALTER WHAT MY LIPS
					HAVE UTTERED.” -Psalm 89:34.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he Bible is clear that God did not change the Sabbath from the
					seventh to the first day of the week.
				</p>

			<!-- section 3 -->
			<div class="space-y-3">
				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					3. DID JESUS CHANGE THE SABBATH?
				</h2>

				<p>
					According to Jesus, the Ten Commandments are not subject
					to change:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the
					Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
					I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the
					smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means
					disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.” -Matthew 5:17-18
				</p>
				<p>
					In Guide 16 we discovered that it was Jesus’ custom to worship in
					the synagogue on the Sabbath (Luke 4:16). We also discovered
					that Jesus wanted His disciples to continue experiencing the
					joys of true Sabbath-keeping (Matthew 24:20).
				</p>

				<p>
					It is clear from Jesus’ teaching and example that we still need
					the Sabbath for rest, relaxation, and spending time with God.
				</p>

				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					4. DID THE APOSTLES CHANGE THE SABBATH?
				</h2>

				<p>
					James, the first leader of the early Christian church, wrote
					concerning the Ten Commandments:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just
					one point is guilty of breaking all of it. For he who said, ‘Do
					not commit adultery,’ also said, ‘Do not murder.’ If you do not
					commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.” -James 2:10, 11.
				</p>
				<p>
					Luke, a physician and evangelist in the early church, reports:
				</p>
				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river,
					where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and
					began to speak to the women who had gathered there.” -Acts
					16:13.
				</p>

				<p>
					T
					he New Testament book of Acts mentions 84 times when the
					Sabbath was observed by Christ’s followers, all of them more
					than 14 years after the resurrection of Jesus: 2 Sabbaths at
					Antioch (Acts 13:14, 42, 44); 1 at Philippi (Acts 16:13); 3 at
					T
					hessalonica (Acts 17:2, 3); 78 Sabbaths at Corinth (Acts 18:4,
					11).
				</p>

				<p>
					John, the last of the twelve apostles to die, kept the Sabbath.
					He wrote:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit.” -Revelation 1:10.
				</p>

				<p>
					According to Jesus, the Lord’s Day is the Sabbath:
				</p>
				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.” -Matthew 12:8.
				</p>

				<p>
					A search of the scriptural evidence reveals that the apostles
					made no attempt to change God’s day of rest from the seventh
					to the first day of the week. The New Testament mentions the
					f
					irst day of the week only eight times. In none of these instances
					is the first day of the week spoken of as a holy day, nor is it even
					hinted that we should set it aside as a day of worship. A critical
					examination of the eight texts referring to the first day of the
					week points out these Sunday events:

					<p>
						None of these scriptures suggest that the apostles intended

						mentioned no change of the Sabbath from the seventh to
						the first day of the week. There is clearly no New Testament
						evidence for a change of the Sabbath from Saturday, the

					5. WHERE DID SUNDAY COME FROM?
				</h2>

				<p>
					T
					he apostles clearly warn us that some Christians would drift
					away from the doctrines of New Testament Christianity: “So be
					on guard!” (Acts 20:29-31). And that is exactly what happened
				</p>

				<p>
					Credible historians clearly record how Christians began to
					stray from apostolic purity. Traditions and doctrines which
					Paul, Peter, and the other founders of the Christian church had
					never endorsed gradually crept into the church.
				</p>
				<p>
					T
					he change from Sabbath observance to Sunday observance
					took place after the New Testament was completed and the
					apostles had all died. History records that Christians eventually
					shifted from worshiping and resting on the seventh day to
					the first day of the week. But of course believers didn’t stop
					observing the seventh-day Sabbath on a given weekend and
					then suddenly begin keeping Sunday as the Lord’s Day. The
					earliest authentic instance of Sunday observance by Christians
					occurred in Italy, in the middle of the second century after
					Christ. For a long time after that many Christians observed
					both days, while still others kept only the Sabbath.
				</p>

				<p>
					On March 7, A.D. 321, Constantine the Great issued the first
					civil Sunday law, compelling all the people, except farmers,
					in the Roman Empire to rest on Sunday. This, with five other
					civil laws decreed by Constantine concerning Sunday, set the
					legal precedent for all civil Sunday legislation from that time
					to the present. In the fourth century the Council of Laodicea
					prohibited Christians from abstaining from work on the
					Sabbath, while urging them to honor Sunday by abstaining
					from work if at all possible.
				</p>


				<p>
					History shows that Sunday worship and observance is a man-
					made custom. The Bible gives no authority for doing away
					with the seventh-day Sabbath of the fourth commandment.
					T
					he prophet Daniel predicted that during the Christian era a
					deceptive power would attempt to change God’s law (Daniel
					7:25).

					6. WHO MADE THE CHANGE?
				</h2>

				<p>
					Who officially moved the Sabbath from the seventh day to
					the first day of the week? The Catholic Church claims to have
					done so. In an attempt to save the crumbling Roman Empire,
					well-meaning church leaders compromised and attempted to change the day of worship from Saturday to
					Sunday.
				</p>
				<div class="pl-6">
					<h6> A catechism of the Roman Catholic Church reads:</h6>
					<p>“Q. Which is the Sabbath day?</p>
					<p>“A. Saturday is the Sabbath day.</p>
					<p> “Q. Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday?</p>
					<p> “A. We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the
						Catholic Church . . . transferred the solemnity from
						Saturday to Sunday.”-Peter Geiermann, The Convert’s
						Catechism of Catholic Doctrine (1957 edition), p. 50.</p>
				</div>



				<p>
					T
					he Catholic Church proudly announces that human church
					leaders made the change.
				</p>

				<p>
					“The holy day, the Sabbath, was changed from Saturday to
					Sunday . . . not from any directions noted in the Scriptures,
					but from the Church’s sense of its own power. . . . People who
					think that the Scriptures should be the sole authority, should
					logically become 7th Day Adventists, and keep Saturday holy.” - Cardinal Maida, Archbishop of
					Detroit, Saint Catherine
					Catholic Church Sentinel, Algonac, Michigan, May 21, 1995

					7. WHAT DO SOME PROTESTANT CHURCHES SAY?
				</h2>



				<p>
					Official documents outlining the beliefs of several Protestant
					denominations agree that the Bible provides no authority for
					Sunday observance.
				</p>

				<p>
					Martin Luther, founder of the Lutheran Church, wrote in the
					Augsburg Confession, Article 28, paragraph 9:
				</p>

				<p>
					“They [the Roman Catholics] allege the Sabbath changed
					into Sunday, the Lord’s Day, contrary to the decalogue [the
					Ten Commandments], . . . neither is there any example more
					boasted of than the changing of the Sabbath day. Great, say they,
					is the power and authority of the church, since it dispensed
					with one of the ten commandments.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Methodist theologians Amos Binney and Daniel Steele
					observed: “It is true, there is no positive command for infant
					baptism . . . nor is there any for keeping holy the first day of
					the week.”-Theological Compend (New York: Methodist Book
					Concern, 1902), pp. 180, 181.
				</p>



				<p>
					Dr. N. Summerbell, historian of the Disciples of Christ or
					Christian Church, wrote: “The Roman Church had totally
					apostatized. . . . It reversed the Fourth Commandment by
					doing away with the Sabbath of God’s Word, and instituting
					Sunday as a holy day.” -A True History of the Christian and the
					Christian Church, pp. 417, 418.

					8. WHAT IS THE REAL ISSUE?
				</h2>

				<p>
					T
					his brings us face-to-face with the questions: Why do so many
					Christians observe Sunday without Bible authority?
				</p>

				<p>
					Even more important, Which day shall I keep? Shall I follow
					those who say, “I don’t think it makes any difference which day
					I observe as long as I keep one day in seven”? Or, shall I count
					as important the day Jesus, our Creator, established when He
					created our world, and the day God pointed out in the Ten
					Commandments: “the seventh day is the Sabbath”?
				</p>

				<p>
					Here we are dealing with more than just an outward observance,
					but which day happens to be biblically correct. The essential
					issue is that of obedience to Jesus. Our Creator set aside the
					Sabbath as a “holy” day, as a time for us and our families to
					come closer to Him for strength and refreshment. Whom shall
					I obey? Shall I obey Christ, the Son of God, or human tradition
					in the matter of the day I keep holy? The choice is clear: the
					teachings of men or the commands of God. The word of men
					or the Word of God. A human substitute or a divine command.
				</p>
				<p>
					T
					he prophet Daniel sounds a warning to those who would
					“try to change the set times and the laws” (Daniel 7:25, NIV)
					[“intend to to change times and law” (Daniel 7:25, NKJV)].
					God is calling His people back to obedience. He invites them to
					keep the Sabbath as a symbol of loyalty and love to Him.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus said, “If you love me, you will obey what I command”
					(John 14:15). And He promises fullness of joy to those who
					love Him enough to obey His commands (John 15:9-11).
				</p>


				<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
					<div class="col-span-3 space-y-2 text-justify  md:px-0">
						<p>
							We have a wonderful Savior. He is eager for us to experience
							His love in all its fullness. A heart of willing obedience opens
							the door wide to that love.
						</p>

						<p>
							In the Garden of Gethsemane Christ submitted completely to
							the Father’s will-even though He faced the cross and the sins of
							the world were crushing out His life. As He cried out to God,
							“Take this cup from me,” He remained surrendered in His
