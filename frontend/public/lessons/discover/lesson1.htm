				1. Everything Designed Has a Designer

				<p>
					The design of the human body demands the existence
					of a designer. Scientists tell us that the brain stores and
					remembers thousands of mental images, integrates
					and solves problems, appreciates beauty, comprehends
					self, and desires to develop the best in each person.
					Electrical charges originating from the brain control
					all the muscular activity of our bodies.
					Computers also function through electrical impulses.
					But it took a human mind to invent the computer and
					a human being to build the computer and tell it what to
					do. No wonder the psalmist concluded that the human
					body speaks loud and clear of a wonderful Creator:

			<blockquote class="italic">
				“I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made...” – Psalm 139:14
			</blockquote>

				(Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the New International
				Version of the Bible.)
			</p>

			<P>
				We don’t have to go far to find the “works” of God.
				The intricate design of the human brain and the other
				organs of our body are the “works” of God, and point
				to an infinitely skillful designer. No pump built by
				The human body is a complete system of organs-all
				interrelated, all thoroughly designed. The lungs and
				heart, nerves and muscles, all perform incredibly
				complicated tasks that depend on other incredibly
				complicated tasks.
				If you were to mark ten coins from one to ten, put
				them in your pocket, shake them around, and then
				pull them out and put them back in your pocket one
				by one, what is the likelihood you could do so in exact
				numerical sequence? By mathematical law you have
				only one chance in ten billion of taking them out in
				order from one to ten.
				Now consider the chances of a stomach, brain, heart,
				liver, arteries, veins, kidneys, ears, eyes, and teeth all
				developing together and beginning to function at the
				same moment in time. What is the most reasonable
				explanation for the design of the human body?
				“Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, in
				our likeness,’ . . . SO GOD CREATED MAN IN HIS
				OWN IMAGE, . . . male and female he created them.” -Genesis 1:26, 27.
				The first man and woman could not just have happened.
				The Bible affirms that God designed us in His image.
				He thought us up and brought us into being.

					</p>

					<blockquote class="italic">
						“In the beginning God created the heavens and the
						earth.” -Genesis 1:1.
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote class="italic">
						“[God] is before all things, and in him all things hold

					<p>
						All creation testifies about God the Master Designer
						and Infinite Creator. In the simple words, “in the
						beginning God,” we find the answer to the mystery of
						life. There is a God who created everything.
						Many great scientific minds today believe in God.
						Dr. Arthur Compton, Nobel Prize-winning physicist,
						commenting on this verse of Scripture, once said:
						“For myself, faith begins with a realization that a
						supreme intelligence brought the universe into being
						and created man. It is not difficult for me to have this
						faith, for it is plain that where there is a plan there is
						a divine intelligence. An orderly, unfolding universe
						testifies to the truth of the most majestic statement
						ever uttered-’In the beginning God.’”
					</p>

					<P>
						T
						he Bible does not attempt to prove God-it declares
						His existence. Dr. Arthur Conklin, a noted biologist,
						once wrote: “The probability of life originating from
						an accident is comparable to the probability of an
						unabridged dictionary resulting from an explosion in
						a print shop.”
					</P>

					<p>
						We know that human beings can’t make something
						from nothing. We may build things, invent things,
						put things together, but we have never brought into
						being from scratch even the tiniest frog or the simplest
						f
						lower. The things about us cry out that God designed,
						God created, God sustains. The only believable answer
						to the origin of the universe, this world, and human
						beings-is God.

				3. God Comes Into Personal Relationships with People
			</h2>
			<p>
				The God who designed the starry heavens, who created
				the universe, seeks a personal relationship with us. He
				had a personal relationship with Moses:
				“The Lord would speak to Moses . . . as a man speaks
				with his friend” (Exodus 33:11). And God wants to
				enter into a personal relationship with you and become
				your Friend. Jesus promised those who follow Him:
				“You are my friends” (John 15:14).
				We have all wrestled with the idea of God, for humans
				are naturally religious. No animal ever builds an altar
				for worship. Yet everywhere you find men and women,
				you find them worshiping. Deep within every human
				heart is a natural desire to worship, an awareness of
				God, a desire to become a friend of God. When we
				respond to our longing and find God, there is no
				longer a doubt about His existence and our need.
				During the 1990s millions of atheists in Russia
				renounced atheism and turned to God. A university
				professor in St. Petersburg made a statement that
				typifies the comments made by many transformed
				atheists in the former Soviet Union:
				“I have searched for a meaning to life in my scientific
				research, but found nothing to have confidence in. The
				scientists around me have the same empty feeling. As
				I looked at the vastness of the universe in my study of
				astronomy, and the emptiness of my soul, I felt there
				must be some meaning. Then, when I received the
				Bible you gave me and began reading it, the vacuum
				in my life was filled. I have found the Bible to be the
				only source of confidence to my soul. I have accepted
				Jesus as my Savior and have found true peace and
				satisfaction in life.”
			</p>

			<p>
				A Christian believes in God because he or she has met
				Him and discovers that He satisfies the heart’s deepest
				needs. The God whom Christians have joyfully found to exist, gives us a new perspective, new meaning,
				new
				motives, and new joys.
				God doesn’t promise a life free from trouble and
				conflict, but He does assure us that He will guide and
				sustain us if we come into a personal relationship with
				Him. And millions of Christians will testify that they
				would give up everything rather than go back to a life
				without God.
				T
				his is the greatest wonder of all-that the Almighty
				God who designed, created, and sustains the universe
				also desires a personal relationship with every man
				and woman, boy and girl. David marvelled at this,
				when he wrote:
				“When I consider your heavens, the work of your
				f
				ingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set
				in place, what is man that you are mindful of him?” -
				Psalm 8:3, 4.
				Our Creator is “mindful” of each one of us. He takes
				as personal an interest in you as if you were the only
				being He had created.

					4. WHAT KIND OF GOD IS HE?
				</h2>

				<p>
					It is only reasonable that a personal God would want
					to reveal Himself to His created beings just as a father
					desires that his children know him. And in the Bible
					God tells us who He is and what He is like.
					What pattern did God use for creating men and
					women?
					“So God created man in his own image, in the image of
					God he created him.” -Genesis 1:27.
					Since we are made in God’s image, our abilities to
					reflect and feel, to remember and hope, to ponder and
					analyze-all are derived from Him.
					What is God’s dominant trait?
					“God is love.” -1 John 4:8.
					God relates to human beings out of His own heart
					of love. There is nothing He has done or ever will do
					which is not motivated by a selfless, sacrificial love.

					5. HOW JESUS REVEALS WHAT GOD IS LIKE
				</h2>

				<p>
					In the Bible God repeatedly speaks of Himself as a
					father.
					“Have we not all one Father? Did not one God create
					us?” -Malachi 2:10.
					Some of the father images we see today are anything
					but desirable. There are neglectful dads, abusive dads.
					God is not like that. He is a caring, sensitive Father. He
					is the kind of Dad who loves to play games with his son
					or daughter, the kind of Dad who charms his kids by
					telling wonderful bedtime stories.
					Our loving Father wanted to do more than reveal
					Himself through the words of Scripture. He knew that
					a person we live with is much more real to us than
					someone we only hear about or read about in a book.
					So He came to our world as a real person-the person
					of Jesus.
					“[Jesus] is the image of the invisible God.” - Colossians
					1:15.
					So if you have seen Jesus, you have seen God. He came
					down on our level-He became like us-so He could
					teach us how to live and be happy, and so we could see
					what God is really like. Jesus is God made visible. He
					Himself said, “Anyone who has seen me has seen the
					Father” (John 14:9).
					As you read the story of Jesus in the four Gospels,
					the first four books of the New Testament, you will
					discover a fascinating portrait of our heavenly Father.
					Rough fishermen dropped their nets to follow Christ,
					and small children flocked to receive His blessing. He
					could comfort the most devastated sinner and disarm
					the most self-righteous hypocrite.
					He healed everything from blindness to leprosy. In all
					His actions Jesus demonstrated that God is love! He
					met human need in a way no one had ever done before
					Him-or has since!
					Jesus’ final glorious revelation of what God is like
					happened at the cross.
					“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and
					only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish,
					but have eternal life.” -John 3:16.
					Jesus died not only to give us a happier life now,
					but also to give us eternal life. For long ages people
					wondered, and hoped, and dreamed about God. They
					saw His handiwork in the sky and in the beauties of
					nature.
				</p>

				<p>

					hen at the cross, Jesus broke the silence of the ages,
					and people found themselves looking into the very
					face of God, seeing Him as He really is-love, eternal
					and immortal love!
					You can discover God right now as Jesus reveals Him.
					That discovery will lead you to make a very personal
					affirmation: “Father, I love you!”
