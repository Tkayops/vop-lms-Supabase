					Anatoli Levitin, a Russian writer and historian, spent
					years in the Siberian Gulag where petitions to God
					must have seemed frozen to the ground. But he
					came back quite spiritually fit. “The greatest miracle of
					all is prayer,” he wrote. “I have only to turn mentally to
					God and at once I feel a force that pours into me from
					somewhere, into my soul, my whole being. What is it?
					Where would I, an insignificant old man and tired of life,
					get this strength which renews and saves me, elevating
					me above the earth? It comes from outside me-and there
					is no force in the world which could ever resist it.” In this
					guide we will see how prayer can help us build a stronger
					relationship with God and a robust Christian life.

					1. CONVERSATION WITH GOD
				</h2>

				<p>
					How can we be sure God hears us when we pray?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Then you will call upon me and come and PRAY TO
					ME, and I WILL LISTEN TO YOU. You will seek me and
					f
					ind me when you seek me with all your heart.” -Jeremiah
					29:12, 13. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in
					the DISCOVER guides are from the New International
					Version of the Bible [NIV].)
				</p>

				<p>
					What assurance did Jesus give that He will hear and
					answer our prayers?
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and
					you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.” -Luke 11:9.
				</p>

				<p>
					Prayer is a two-way conversation. That’s what Jesus
					promises:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone
					hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and
					eat with him, and he with me.” -Revelation 3:20.
				</p>

				<p>
					How is it possible to sit down and have a nice evening
					of dinner conversation with Christ? First, by telling
					Him everything that’s on our hearts in prayer. Second,
					by listening carefully. As we meditate in prayer, God can
					speak to us directly. And as we read the Word of God
					devotionally, God will speak to us through its pages
				</p>

				<p>
					Prayer can become a way of life for the Christian.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“PRAY CONTINUALLY; give thanks in all
					circumstances, for this is God’s will for you in Christ
					Jesus.” -1 Thessalonians 5:16-18.
				</p>

				<p>
					How can we “pray continually”? Do we have to stay on
					our knees all the time or constantly repeat phrases of adoration or petition? Of course not. But we
					are to live
					so closely in touch with Jesus that we feel free to speak to
					Him anytime, anywhere.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“In the crowds of the street, in the midst of a business
					engagement, we may send up a petition to God and
					plead for divine guidance...We should have the door of
					the heart open continually and our invitation going up
					that Jesus may come and abide as a heavenly guest in
					the soul.”- Steps to Christ, p. 99.
				</p>

				<p>
					One of the best ways to develop this kind of intimate
					relationship is to learn to meditate as we pray.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in
					the LORD.” -Psalm 104:34.
				</p>

				<p>
					Don’t just rush through a list of requests when you pray.
					Wait. Listen. A little prayerful reflection can greatly
					enrich your relationship with God.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					Come near to God and he will come near to you.” -James 4:8.
				</p>

				<p>
					The closer we come to Jesus, the more we’re able to
					experience His presence. So keep within speaking
					distance of Jesus, and don’t worry about saying the
					right words. Just talk honestly and openly. Talk about
					everything. He’s gone through the agony of death itself in
					order to become your Intimate Friend
				</p>

				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					2. HOW TO PRAY
				</h2>

				<p>
					When we engage in prayer, we may wish to follow the
					outline of the Lord’s Prayer, the model prayer Jesus
					taught His disciples in response to their request: “Teach
					us to pray.”
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your
					kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in
					heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our
					debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead
					us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one,
					for yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory
					forever. Amen.” -Matthew 6:9-13, margin.
				</p>

				<p>
					According to the pattern Jesus provided in His prayer,
					we are to come to God as our heavenly Father. Ask that
					His will take charge in our hearts just as His will prevails
					in all of heaven. We seek Him for our physical needs, for
					forgiveness, and for a forgiving attitude. Remember that
					our ability to resist sin comes from God. Christ’s prayer
					concludes with expressions of praise.
				</p>

				<p>
					On another occasion Jesus instructed His disciples to
					pray to the Father “in my name” (John 16:23)-that is,
					to pray in harmony with Jesus’ principles. That’s why
					Christians usually close their prayers with the words: “In
					Jesus’ name, Amen.” Amen is a Hebrew word that means
					“Let it be so.” Although the Lord’s Prayer gives guidelines
					on what to pray for and how to formulate a prayer, our
					communication with God works best as a spontaneous
					composition of the heart. We can pray about everything.
					God invites us to pray about forgiveness for our sins (1
					John 1:9), increased faith (Mark 9:24), the necessities of
					life (Matthew 6:11), healing from suffering and disease
					(James 5:15), and the outpouring of the Spirit (Zechariah
					10:1). Jesus assures us that we can take all our needs and
					cares to Him; nothing is too small to pray about.
				</p>



				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.” -1 Peter 5:7.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our Savior is interested in every detail of our lives. His
					heart warms when our hearts reach out to Him in love
					and faith.
				</p>

				<h2 class=" font-semibold uppercase">
					3. PRIVATE PRAYER
				</h2>

				<p>
					Most of us have things we hesitate sharing even with our
					closest friends. So God invites us to unburden ourselves
					in private prayer: one-on-one with Him. It’s not that
					He needs any information. The Almighty knows our
					secret fears, hidden motives, and buried resentments
					better than we do ourselves. But we need to open up our
					hearts to the One who knows us intimately and loves us
					infinitely. Healing can begin when Jesus can touch our
					wounds.
				</p>

				<p>
					When we pray, Jesus, our High Priest, is near to help us:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“We have one who has been TEMPTED IN EVERY
					WAY, JUST AS WE ARE-yet was without sin. Let us then
					approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we
					may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time
					of need.” -Hebrews 4:15, 16.
				</p>

					<div class="col-span-3 space-y-2 text-justify  md:px-0">


						<p>
							Do you feel anxious, stressed-out, guilty? Lay it out before
							the Lord. He can then supply our every need.
						</p>
						<p>
							Should we have a special place for private prayer?
						</p>

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“When you pray, go into your room, close the door and
							pray to your Father, who . . . will reward you.” - Matthew
							6:6.
						</p>

						<p>
							In addition to praying when walking in the street, working
							on the job, or enjoying a social gathering, every Christian
							should have a time set aside each day for personal prayer
							and Bible study. Make your daily appointment with God
							at the time when you feel most alert and can concentrate
							the best.

					4. PUBLIC PRAYER
				</h2>

				<p>
					Joining with others in prayer creates a special bond and
					invites God’s power in a special way.
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“For where two or three come together in my name,
					there am I with them.” -Matthew 18:20
				</p>

				<p>
					One of the greatest things we can do as a family is to
					develop a prayer life together. Show your children that
					we can take our needs to Him directly. They’ll get excited
					about God as they see Him respond to prayer in the
					practical details of life. Make family worship a happy,
					relaxed time of sharing.

					5. SEVEN SECRETS OF ANSWERED PRAYER
				</h2>

				<p>
					When Moses prayed, the Red Sea parted. When Elijah
					prayed, fire came down from heaven. When Daniel
					prayed, an angel shut the mouths of ravenous lions.
					T he Bible presents us with many exciting accounts of
					answered prayer. And it recommends prayer as the way
					to tap into the mighty power of God.
				</p>


				<p>
					Jesus promises:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do
					it.” -John 14:14.
				</p>

				<p>
					Yet some prayers seem to go unheeded. Why? Here are
					seven principles that will help you pray more effectively:
				</p>

				<div class="space-y-3 pl-6">
					<div>
						<p>
							(1) Keep close to Christ.
						</p>
						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“IF YOU REMAIN IN ME and my words remain
							in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given
							you.” - John 15:7.
						</p>
						<p>
							When we make our relationship with God a
							priority and keep in touch with Him, we’ll be
							listening and looking for answers to our prayers
							that, otherwise, might go undetected.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<p>
							(2) Keep trusting God.
						</p>

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“If you BELIEVE, you will receive whatever you
							ask for in prayer.” -Matthew 21:22.
						</p>

						<p>
							To believe, or have faith, means that we’re really
							looking to our heavenly Father to supply our need.
							If you’re troubled by a lack of faith remember that
							our Savior performed a miracle for the man who
							pled in desperation:
						</p>

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!” -Mark 9:24.
						</p>

						<p>
							Just concentrate on exercising the faith you DO
							have; don’t worry about the faith you DON’T have.
						</p>
					</div>


					<div>
						<p>
							(3) Surrender calmly to God’s will.
						</p>

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“This is the confidence we have in approaching
							God: that if we ask anything ACCORDING TO
							HIS WILL, he hears us.” -1 John 5:14.
						</p>

						<p>
							Remember that God wants to teach us, as well
							as give us things, through prayer. So sometimes
							He says, “No”; sometimes He turns us in another
							direction. Prayer is a means of getting more
							and more in touch with God’s will. We need to
							be sensitive to God’s responses and learn from
							them. Keeping track of specific requests and what
							happens as a result is a great help. The Holy Spirit
							will help you zero in on the right mark: “The Spirit
							intercedes for the saints in accordance with God’s
							will” (Romans 8:27). Remember that our will
							would always coincide with God’s will if we could
							see as He does.
						</p>


					</div>

					<div>
						<p>
							(4) Wait patiently on God.
						</p>

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“I WAITED PATIENTLY for the LORD; he turned
							to me and heard my cry.” -Psalm 40:1.

						<p>
							The main point here is to keep your focus on
							God, keep your focus on His solution. And don’t
							ask God for support one minute and then try to
							drown your troubles in pleasure-seeking the next.
							Wait patiently on the Lord; we badly need that
							discipline.
						</p>


					</div>

					<div>
						<p>
							(5) Don’t hang on to any sin.
						</p>

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“If I had CHERISHED SIN IN MY HEART, the
							Lord would not have listened.” -Psalm 66:18.

						<p>
							Known sin short-circuits the power of God in our
							lives; it separates us from God (Isaiah 59:1-2). You
							can’t hang onto sin with one hand and reach out
							for divine help with the other. Sincere confession
							and repentance solves the problem. If we’re not
							willing to allow God to free us from evil thoughts,
							words, and deeds, our prayers won’t be effective.
						</p>

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“When you ask, you do not receive, because you
							ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what
							you get on your pleasures.” -James 4:3.
						</p>

						<p>
							God isn’t going to answer “yes” to selfish prayers.
							Keep your ears open to God’s law, His will, and He
							will keep His ears open to your petitions.
						</p>

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“If anyone turns a deaf ear to the law, even his
							prayers are detestable.” -Proverbs 28:9.
						</p>


					</div>


					<div>
						<p>
							(6) Feel the need of God.
						</p>

						<p>
							God responds to those who ask for His presence
							and power in their lives.
						</p>

						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“If I had CHERISHED SIN IN MY HEART, the
							Lord would not have listened.” -Psalm 66:18.


						<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
							“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst
							for righteousness, for they will be filled.” -Matthew 5:6.
						</p>



					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							(7) Persist in prayer.
						</p>

						<p>
							Jesus illustrated the need to persist in our petitions
							by telling the story of a very persistent widow who
							kept coming to a judge with her request. At last the
							judge said in exasperation, “Because this widow
							keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice.”
							Then Jesus concluded: “Will not God bring about
							justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day
							and night? Will he keep putting them off?” (Luke
							18:5-7). Discuss all your needs, hopes, and dreams
							with God. Ask for particular blessings, for help in
							time of need. Keep seeking, and keep listening,
							until you learn something from God’s response.

					6. ANGELS MINISTER TO THE NEEDS OF THOSE
					WHO PRAY
				</h2>

				<p>
					T

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“I sought the LORD, and he answered me; he delivered

				<p>
					When we pray, God sends angels to answer our prayers
					(Hebrews 1:14). Each Christian has an accompanying
					guardian angel:
				</p>

				<p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
					“See that you do not look down on one of these little ones.

					7. THE CHRISTIAN LIFESTYLE
				</h2>

				<p>
					The Bible describes a distinct Christian lifestyle.
					According to Ephesians 4:22-24, the Christian is to “put
					off” the old lifestyle that resulted from “deceitful desires,”
					and “put on” the new lifestyle that is “created to be like
					God.” In this scripture and in Guide 6 we discovered that
					at the new birth we are “re-created” to be a different kind
					of person in Christ. This guide and the six guides which
					follow, showcase the Christian lifestyle; they reveal the
					secrets of a happy Christian life. They will help you build
					a stronger relationship with Christ, that will result in a
					distinct Christian lifestyle. So fix your eyes on Jesus today
					and you can be part of that final victory celebration when
					Christ’s peace reigns unchallenged
