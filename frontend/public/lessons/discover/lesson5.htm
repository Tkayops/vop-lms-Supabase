                    They found his skeleton beside a makeshift shelter on
                    a desolate island in the mid-Atlantic. The anonymous
                    seaman kept a journal which detailed his four-month
                    ordeal. He’d been set ashore on Ascension Island by the Dutch
                    f
                    leet in 1725 for some unmentioned crime. Soon he was
                    reduced to drinking the blood of turtles just to quench his
                    raging thirst. The man’s physical suffering was intense, but an
                    even greater pain stands out in his journal: his overwhelming
                    guilt.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He penned tormented words such as: “What pangs do
                    wretched mortals feel who leave the paths of righteousness,
                    pleased to increase the numbers of the damned.” This seaman’s
                    greatest isolation on that lonely island came from his sense of
                    separation from God. That is what proved unbearable in the
                    end. Human beings have been struggling with that isolation
                    of the heart ever since Adam and Eve “hid from the LORD
                    God among the trees of the garden” after eating the forbidden
                    fruit (Genesis 3:8). The strange new emotions of shame, guilt,
                    and fear compelled that first couple to run away when God
                    came calling Those feelings are unfortunately quite familiar
                    to us now

                    What is it that causes a separation between us and God?

                    1. SATISFYING OUR HIDDEN HUNGER
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Before sin spoiled the picture, Adam and Eve enjoyed intimacy
                    with their Creator in a beautiful Garden home in Eden.
                    Tragically, they bought Satan’s lie about becoming as wise as
                    God and broke the bond of trust with their Maker (Genesis 3).
                </p>

                <p>
                    After being expelled from the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve
                    found life a lot tougher on the outside. Childbearing and tilling
                    the soil now came with blood, sweat, and tears. Their close
                    bond with God broken, they found themselves vulnerable to
                    unsatisfied desires and painful yearnings-the loneliness of sin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since Adam and Eve’s first act of rebellion, “all” (the entire
                    human race) have fallen into the same sin pattern and are
                    subject to death, sin’s ultimate penalty.
                </p>

                <p class="italic font-semibold text-sm">
                    “Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man,
                    and death through sin, and in this way DEATH CAME TO
                    ALL MEN, because ALL SINNED.” -Romans 5:12.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We all experience a great hunger of the heart for that which
                    we’ve lost, a longing for a kind of security which only God can
                    give. We often try to satisfy that hunger by a shopping binge,
                    or a mad race for promotion at work, or by simply drowning out the hunger with alcohol, drugs, or
                    promiscuity. But all our
                    yearnings are symptoms of a loneliness for God. And there is
                    no cure except experiencing His love in our life.

                    “You...will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal
                    pleasures at your right hand.” -Psalm 16:11.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Real satisfaction will only come when that gap between us and
                    God is bridged and we’re able to walk over into His presence.

                <p>
                    People are not the only ones made lonely by sin. God’s heart
                    ached too on the day Adam and Eve turned their backs on Him.
                    And He still grieves over human sorrows and tragedies. God is
                    eager to satisfy our hidden longings and to heal our emotional
                    wounds. He wasn’t content just to look sympathetically across
                    the chasm that separates us from Him. God decided to become
                    a bridge across the chasm of sin and death.

                    God gave His Son, and Jesus gave His life as a sacrifice for
                    sin, paying the death penalty Himself. His life, death, and
                    resurrection made it possible to forgive and save sinners
                    without trivializing sin, and gave the universe a demonstration
                    of the true character of Christ and Satan. The bridge of Christ’s
                    broken, bleeding body draws people back from the trap of sin.
                    Love spans the chasm, enabling all who place their faith in
                    Christ as Lord and Savior to walk over into eternal life.

                                        the Devil unleashed his fiercest assault against His
                                        integrity (Matthew 4:1-11). In Gethsemane before His
                                        crucifixion, the pressure of temptation reached such
                                        intensity, Jesus sweat drops of blood (Luke 22:44).

                                        understands our struggles. He is able “to sympathize

                    After that, U Long had as little to do with his wife as possible.
                    She tried her best to make him happy; she worked hard at
                    home, hoping her husband would eventually accept her. But he
                    remained coldly indifferent to all her expressions of affection.

                    After twelve years of this sham marriage, U Long began to lose
                    vision in both eyes. A doctor told him he would go completely
                    blind if he didn’t have a cornea transplant. But the operation
                    was expensive and there was a long waiting list.

                    Golden Flower began to work long hours in the evening making
                    straw hats for extra money. One day, U Long was informed that
                    someone’s cornea had been made available after an accident.
                    He rushed to the hospital to have the operation.

                    After he had recovered, he grudgingly decided to see his wife
                    so he could thank her for raising the money.

                    When he turned her bowed head so she could look at him, U
                    Long gasped. She stared at him with sightless, blank eyes, the
                    cornea gone. Overcome with emotion, he sank at her feet and
                    sobbed. And then for the first time he whispered her name:
                    Golden Flower.

                    Jesus longs for a relationship with those who’ve been indifferent
                    to Him for so long. He longs for us to finally whisper His name
                    as our Savior. He was willing to sacrifice not only His eyes but
                    His whole body in order to demonstrate His unfailing love. His
                    love is so powerful that Christ “came into the world to save
                    sinners” (1 Timothy 1:15).

                    Christ’s great sacrifice has created a bridge that spans our
                    indifference, that covers our alienation. Have you personally
                    discovered that He wants to draw you over the chasm and
                    into His arms? Will you respond and pray, “Jesus, I love You.
                    T
                    hank You for Your incredible sacrifice. Come into my heart
                    and save me now-save me wholly, save me completely, save me
                    eternally”?
